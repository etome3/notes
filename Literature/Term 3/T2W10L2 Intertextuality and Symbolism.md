## **Intertextuality Review:**
Intertextuality is a key form of textual connection and occurs when a text purposefully refers to or suggests another text. This device can add greater depth and meaning to a text and creates an avenue for an author to communicate particular representations and perspectives, whilst also providing a platform for readers and viewers to connect to a text. Intertextuality can be divided into subtypes: appropriation, allusion, parody, and pastiche.
	<u>Appropriation</u> - where a text adapts, reimagines or reinterprets an existing text and creates a new text. For example, Marvel have adapted the narratives from the original comic book series in their movies, _The Hunger Games_ films are appropriations of the novels by Suzanne Collins and Cole Porter’s play _Kiss Me Kate_ is an adaptation of Shakespeare’s _The Taming of the Shrew_.
	<u>Allusion</u> - when a text references an existing text, person, place or event, it is known as **allusion** and is another form of intertextuality. These connections are not explicit or sometimes easily recognisable and it is up to the reader or viewer to determine the connection. Allusions fall under 4 categories:
		**Historical** – if someone suffers a massive defeat in a competition or challenge, it can be described as their ‘Waterloo’. This references Napoleon’s defeat in the battle of Waterloo in 1816 where the English finally defeated the French. He abdicated shortly afterwards.
		**Literary** – we often refer to someone who is greedy, bitter and miserly as a Scrooge. This label is directly referencing the character Scrooge in Charles Dickens’ _A Christmas Carol_ who embodied all of these traits.
		**Biblical** - in C S Lewis’ novel _The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe_, the lion character Aslan’s execution and resurrection alludes to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ with the character Edmund, who betrays him, resembling Judas Iscariot.
		**Cultural** – when we refer to someone as our muse, we allude to the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne who were beings who inspired creativity, motivation and brilliance in Greek mythology.
<u>Parody</u> - an imitation of a text. It satirises, mocks or distorts a more serious text. An example is Shakespeare’s Sonnet 130 which parodies the genre of love poems that were popular in the period he was writing in.
<u>Pastiche</u> - another form of imitation in literature. However, it differs from parody. Whilst parody seeks to ridicule or jest at a work or a genre, pastiche pays homage to the original text.
### **The stylistic and aesthetic purpose of intertextuality in literature**
Intertextuality is used in literature for a variety of purpose.
<u>Stylistic purposes:</u>
- To create deeper or additional layers of meaning
- To challenge perspectives or CAAVB in other texts
- Create connections with the reader drawing upon the reader’s prior knowledge and interactions with other texts
<u>Aesthetic purposes:</u>
- Reinterpretation of texts in creative ways
- Enhance themes in texts
- When readers recognise a reference, it can enhance engagement
- Create surprise or intrigue
- Engage readers critically
- Enhance universal themes or enduring CAAVBs
## **Activity 1:**
*The Penelopiad* would fall under **appropriation**, as Margaret Atwood purposefully references and reworks major story elements and themes from Homer’s *The Odyssey* for the purpose of creating an original story from a new perspective.
In its appropriation of Homer’s original text, *The Penelopiad* creates connections and contrasts that reform the story of *The Odyssey* into that of a modern feminist perspective.

### <u>Mythological archetypes and Greek choruses</u>
In _The Penelopiad_, Margaret Atwood represents common mythological archetypes such as the hero, the earth mother and the temptress but revises and subverts traditional representations in order to make a comment on humanity.
Atwood also uses the maids as a reference to classical Greek choruses The maids, as one body, lament their treatment and executions and offer a perspective on humanity, gender, class and inequality that is absent from the original text.
## **Activity 2:**
1. What comment does Atwood make about humanity through her use of subverted traditional mythological archetypes?

2. **Identify** further uses of intertextuality in _The Penelopiad_ and **explain** the stylistic and/or aesthetic purpose.

## **Symbolism**
Aesthetic features position the reader to think and feel about the character/s, time and place, and concepts. Symbolism is an aesthetic feature and a form of figurative language. Margaret Atwood uses symbolism within the text to affect the reader, building connections between the tangible and intangible - between the explicit and implicit meaning her words create. When analysing the layers of meaning that come from symbols that signal deeper connections, we first need to ascertain the meaning the symbols embodies. For example whilst white is often a symbol of peace, purity or innocence, we can also attach other meanings, such as death - depending upon the accepted values and beliefs.  
Symbolism makes you think further into the meaning beyond the words. By analysing the symbolism used within the text, you will gain further insight into the messages (themes) or perspectives Atwood embeds within the novel.
It is important to consider the ways in which meaning is multilayered within the texts - not only through the structural lens but also through the use of characters' actions and reactions, what they see hear or speak about, and how settings reflect or disrupt the stories that Penelope and the women in the monologues tell.

## **Activity 4:**
**Identify** other symbols that are found in the text and **select** 3 symbols:

1. **Explain** the significance and effect of each symbol on the reader.

2. **Explain** how the use of the symbol positions readers to take up positions.
