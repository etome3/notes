## *The purpose of an analytical essay*
The central purpose of an analytical essay in Literature is to inform the reader of an interpretation of a literary text. This analysis is written in a formal tone, includes relevant literary terminology and follows appropriate academic conventions. The audience of an analytical essay is an educated reader familiar with the literary text being discussed. Like any genre, there are many valid ways to respond in an analytical essay.

In the subject Literature, the types of interpretations of literary texts that students are expected to produce change in focus and complexity throughout the course. As they progress through the course, students will develop more informed, complex, exploratory and creative interpretations, supported by a closer and more detailed reading of a literary text, having considered others’ interpretations of the text.

An analytical essay is structured around a thesis, which is a statement of the central argument of an essay. This thesis presents an interpretation of a literary text or texts. It is supported by arguments and substantiated by relevant evidence, in the form of discussion, exploration and examination of a literary text. As the focus of an analytical essay is an interpretation of a literary text, the majority of supporting evidence is comprised of references to this text.
## *Writing an Analytical Essay*
An analytical essay, in response to a literary text, is organised so as to best advance and support the established argument or thesis. When writing an analytical essay you need to remember that your reader needs to be able to follow your thinking and ideas. Your writing needs to be deliberate in its meaning making and you must engage the reader to consider your ideas about the novel as valid and rational. Highlight your intellectual reasoning through deliberately selecting interesting and thought-provoking subject matter - including a range of evidence from the novel that provides clear connections to support your ideas and thinking. 

An analytical essay is conventionally segmented into three reading phases.
1. Introduction
2. Arguments
3. Conclusion

Paragraphs organise your subject matter and phases.  These must be clearly indicated through appropriate spacing to guide your reader visibly through your introduction, arguments and conclusion.  When handwriting, paragraphs are indicated by indenting each new phase - you will most probably have several paragraphs in the argument phase with each focussing on a separate claim/argument.
## ++Introduction:++
A good introductory paragraph will set up you up for success in your exam. In this section, we will revise features of a strong introduction.

### Structural Features
In the order shown below, your introduction would typically:
- identify the text and its author, as well as evaluating its general cultural significance
- provide a succinct synopsis relevant to the question - an outline of the text’s purpose and subject matter that is relevant to the topic/question and the thesis statement of the essay
- clear and contentious thesis statement: state your position with regard to the set question/task and as relevant to the text’s
- theme/message or your aesthetic response
- preview the elements (e.g. setting, character, perspective positioning/purpose of author's/creator’s construction and choices) to be examined.
### Language Features
**Evaluative language**  
- use of positive appreciation to evaluate the text (e.g. ‘detailed rendering’, ‘sumptuous’,  
‘exciting’, ‘effective’, ‘significant’)
**Cohesion**  
- use of pronoun reference (e.g. ‘Lady Helen’– ‘she’)
**Packaging and condensing information**  
- use of nominalisation (as seen here in italics) (e.g. ‘The exciting story is used as an effective vehicle for exploring _the societal, familial and personal expectations weighing down young people, especially women_.’)
### Summary
The introductory paragraph of your analytical essay should contain the following: 
- title
- creator/author/director
- an outline of the text’s purpose and subject matter that is relevant to the topic/question and the thesis statement of the essay
- clear and contentious thesis statement
- outline of the essay’s key topics/arguments including Shakespeare’s use of stylistic devices, aesthetic features and cultural assumptions
## **Activity 1:**
**Read** the following example introduction on the Shakespearean play _Hamlet’s_ exploration of the concept revenge and examine how the writer uses structural features.

_The writer of this introduction begins by giving the reader an <font color="#c00000">outline of the text’s purpose and subject matter that is relevant to the topic/question and the thesis statement of the essay.</font> This sentence also incudes the <font color="#00b050">author’s name,</font> another requirement of an essay introduction. The <font color="#0070c0">thesis statement</font> is clear and shows the writer’s intention – to argue the contention that Shakespeare interrogates Elizabethan conventions of tragedy in his play. Lastly, the introduction outlines and previews the main arguments to be discussed._

## ++Arguments:++
Your body paragraphs should explore the question in detail and substantiate the perspective you have provided in the thesis statement. You will need to support your assertions with evidence from the text. You will also need to incorporate a strong topic sentence and use cohesion.

Body paragraphs should be carefully constructed and linked, using evidence and examples from the play to support your perspective. Ensure ideas, paragraphs and sections link back to the thesis and that your arguments are tied together. The order of your arguments will depend on the order that you previewed them in the introductory paragraph – ensure that you maintain the same order.

Throughout the body of your essay you need to focus on:
- ensuring you are answering the question that has been asked
- analysis of the question’s focal character/concept/ideal etc.
- examination on how representations have been constructed in the text
- ensuring all ideas and discussion are linked explicitly or implicitly to the considered perspective you are discussing (thesis)
- the significance of the representations on the audience
- analysis of the ways cultural assumptions, attitudes, values and beliefs underpins the text.
- analysis of how creators use stylistic devices and aesthetic features for particular effects
- selecting and using evidence that best supports your thesis
- using the patterns and conventions appropriate to a critical response in an analytical essay
- use appropriate language features
### Structural Features
Your body paragraphs will typically contain phases such as:
- a topic sentence **stating a claim (topic sentence)** relevant to the question or task
- **elaboration** of the claim
- **argumentation and a pattern of examples** (with supporting quotations or specific text references) to support and develop the claim (chains of evidence)
- **a warrant** that establishes the link between your examples, claim and overall statement of position.
### Language Features
**Evaluative language**  
-  use of appreciation words to evaluate (e.g. ‘Civility is an important principle …’)  
-  use of judgment words to evaluate characters (e.g. ‘good manners’, ‘politeness and decorum  
-  especially avoiding the appearance of sexual impropriety –’)
**Conjunctions and text connectives**  
-  adding information (e.g. ‘in addition’, ‘moreover’, ‘furthermore’)  
-  contrasting ideas (e.g. ‘however’, ‘though’, ‘but’)
**Cohesion**  
-  use of synonyms (e.g. ‘values’ ‘guiding principles’)  
-  part–whole relationships (e.g. novel setting (‘Regency England’), narrator (‘third person’, ‘focaliser’, ‘Lady Helen’))
**Citing and quoting to add authority to textual arguments**  
-  use of a variety of techniques for integrating quotations (e.g. paraphrasing; projecting via a colon, the use of ‘that’, or a saying/thinking verb; incorporating into sentence flow)
**Managing information flow using:**  
-  paragraph openers (topic sentences) to shift the focus of the essay (e.g. ‘Civility is an important principle that guides the upper class in the Regency England of the novel’. The next paragraph begins: ‘However, through the choice of Lady Helen as the focaliser and third person narrator, the reader becomes aware that she recognises this civility as a veneer that masks hypocrisy and violence’).  
- sentence openers (in italics) to shift the focus of a paragraph (e.g. ‘ As a young, unmarried woman, Lady Helen is weighed down by social and familial expectations’; ‘ In the first four chapters, Goodman shows us the tightening spiral of restrictions flowing from these expectations’).

## ++Conclusion:++
Your concluding paragraph should be summation of your argument and link explicitly to, or restate, the thesis. It should also include a final, formal observation of the text that is relevant to the question. No new ideas or information should be included in the conclusion.
### Structural Features
Your conclusion will typically contain phrases such as:
- re-statement of position
- review of elements and arguments
- overall comment or observation, often relating the text to the present.
### Language Features
**Evaluative language**
- use of positive appreciation (in italics) to evaluate the influence of values (e.g. ‘Regency England as represented in the novel is significant in shaping Helen’s values’) and the character of the protagonist (e.g. ‘Lady Helen can be a role model for young people’).
**Conjunctions and text connectives**
- use of linking words to conclude and signal synthesis (e.g. ‘overall’, ‘in conclusion’)
## ++Writing for an informed audience:++
“When you compose an essay, you need to remember that your reader has a deep understanding of the text.
This means:
- the reader does not need a plot summary
- your contention will need to address the question and be worthy of argument
- your response should be validated by quotations, paraphrasing of dialogue, or references to the text
- your evidence will need to reflect an appreciation of the whole text and not just the opening lines, scenes or acts
- your language and grammar will need to be literary, and analytical
- your tone will be formal and academic”
## ++Revision on developing a thesis statement:++
The thesis statement is the key sentence in an introductory paragraph and should be developed before the rest of the paragraph.

_Revision of the components of a thesis statement_
A thesis statement should:
- establish a perspective
- indicate your interpretation of the text in relation to the task question
- be identifiable within the introductory paragraph of your response
- respond to all aspects of the task question
- be stated in one sentence
- be specific, rather than general
- be coherent, which means it can be applied to the entirety of the text studied (_Macbeth_)
- adopt a distinctive style

Your thesis statement should also:
- reveal how you have interpreted the significance of the subject matter in relation to the assessment question
- reveal your _interpretation_ of, _perspective_ of, or _answer_ to a question or subject.
*Example thesis statement*

Note the formal tone and language choices in the thesis statement.
### Developing a thesis statement from a question
To develop an effective thesis statement, you first need to **examine the question** thoroughly. When reading a question, you must read actively, by identifying what you are asked to do and the aspect of the text you are required to analyse.
1. Highlight the cognitive verbs that direct you to what you have to do. These include words such as: analyse, examine, identify, justify, explore, interrogate, explain, discuss.
![[image-12.png|500x160]]
2. Underline the words that indicate the subject you are analysing closely. These are often opinions, contentions or ideas that you will need to agree or disagree with or define as they are represented in the text.
![[image-13.png|500x129]]
3. If applicable, circle verbs that reveal what you will analyse regarding what a text does. These include words such as: positions, challenges, represents, reveals.
4. Ask yourself what the question wants you to interpret and analyse in reference to the
5. Reframe the question in your _own words._
6. Brainstorm what the question is asking you to explore. Perhaps it is a technique, a theme, an attitude or a value.
7. Formulate a clear _answer or perspective_ of the question and state this in your thesis.
## **Activity 2:**
1. **Unpack** the following question:
How are readers invited to view the concept of motherhood in the novella _The Penelopiad_?
2. **Create** a thesis statement in response to the question.

3. **Create** an analytical paragraph response to the question. Your thesis statement will form the basis of your paragraph’s topic sentence.
