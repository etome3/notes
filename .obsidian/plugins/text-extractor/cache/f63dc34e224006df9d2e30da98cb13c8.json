Accidental release measures Wear protective clothing specified for normal operations (see Section 8)Personal Protection Dilute with water and mop up, or absorb with an inert dry material and place in an appropriate waste disposal container. Clean-up Methods - Small Spillages 7. Handling and storage Do not breathe vapour. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Avoid prolonged or repeated exposure. Precautions for Safe Handling Keep containers securely sealed and protected against physical damage. Protect from freezing. Isolate from incompatible substances. Containers of this material may be hazardous when empty since they retain product residues (vapours, liquid). Store at +2 to +8 °C. Keep away from direct sunlight Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatabilities 8. Exposure controls/personal protection Name STEL TWAOccupational exposure limit values mg/m3 ppm ppm Footnote mg/m3 Hydrogen peroxide 1.4 1 A time weighted average (TWA) has been established for hydrogen peroxide (Safe Work Australia) of 1.4 mg/m³, (1 ppm). The exposure value at the TWA is the average airborne concentration of a particular substance when calculated over a normal 8 hour working day for a 5 day working week. Other Exposure Information In industrial situations maintain the concentrations values below the TWA. This may be achieved by process modification, use of local exhaust ventilation, capturing substances at the source, or other methods. Appropriate engineering controls Where ventilation is not adequate, respiratory protection may be required. Avoid breathing vapours or mists. Select and use respirators in accordance with AS 1716 - Respiratory Protective Devices and be selected in accordance with AS 1715 - Selection, Use and Maintenance of Respiratory Protective Devices. When mists or vapours exceed the exposure standards then the use of the following is recommended: Approved respirator with organic vapour and dust/mist filters. Filter capacity and respirator type depends on exposure levels. Respiratory Protection The use of a face shield, chemical goggles or safety glasses with side shield protection as appropriate. Must comply with Australian Standards AS 1337 and be selected and used in accordance with AS 1336. Eye Protection Hand protection should comply with AS 2161, Occupational protective gloves - Selection, use and maintenance. Recommendation: Butyl rubber gloves Hand Protection Final choice of personal protective equipment will depend on individual circumstances and/or according to risk assessments undertaken. Personal Protective Equipment Safety boots in industrial situations is advisory, foot protection should comply with AS 2210, Occupational protective footwear - Guide to selection, care and use. Recommendation: Rubber boots. Footwear Clean clothing or protective clothing should be worn, preferably with an apron. Clothing for protection against chemicals should comply with AS 3765 Clothing for Protection Against Hazardous Chemicals. Body Protection Always wash hands before smoking, eating or using the toilet. Wash contaminated clothing and other protective equipment before storing or re-using. Hygiene Measures 9.
