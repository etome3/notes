You have explored a range of literary texts and the ways aesthetic features and language of film can be manipulated to construct meaning, create particular emotional and critical effects, and engage readers or viewers in critical reflection. In your close study of the film Jasper Jones, you have explored and engaged with the ways particular literary texts construct representations of coming-of-age stories, culture and authenticity. You have also explored how readers or viewers respond to these texts both emotionally and critically. To help you develop deeper and more complex interpretations of the film, you have read/viewed/listened to and discussed others’ perspectives of the film.. Task Create an analytical essay in response to the following: Aboriginal writer Ellen van Neerven states: \"By telling its story from the perspective of its adolescent white protagonist, Jasper Jones channels the innocence and openness of youth; in doing so, however, it also inevitably glosses over the harsher sociocultural realities, watering down the political commentary latent in its narrative.\" To what extent do you agree with van Neerven's perspective?
