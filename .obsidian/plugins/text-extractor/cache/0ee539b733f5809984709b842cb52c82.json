The main difference between a scalar and a vector is that vectors have direction, whereas scalars do not. For instance, the speed of an object is a scalar quantity whereas its velocity is a vector quantity. Consider the tawny owl trying to catch its prey. Knowing the speed of the owl and the mouse would not be enough to determine whether the owl will catch the mouse, you would have to know the direction of each too, that is their velocity. Vectors are used to represent 2-dimesional or 3-dimensional space (in unit 3). In this chapter, you will learn about vectors in two dimensions. Vectors are useful tools to represent such things as position, displacement, velocity, acceleration, momentum etc. Vectors can be used by coaches in many sporting areas to illustrate the importance of the angle of contact with the ball or the optimum position to kick a goal. By watching film clips with vectors superimposed over their golf swings, professional golfers can determine the perfect angle to hold their club to achieve the best outcome. 110 Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Specialist Mathematics Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition 3.1.2 Syllabus links Lesson Lesson title Syllabus links 3.2 Vectors and scalars ● Examine examples of vectors including displacement, velocity and force. ● Understand the difference between a scalar and a vector including distance and displacement, speed and velocity, and magnitude of force and force. ● Define and use the magnitude and direction of a vector. ● Understand and use vector notation: ⃗AB, c ˜ , d, unit vector notation ̂n. ● Understand and use vector equality. ● Represent and use a scalar multiple of a vector. ● Use the triangle rule to represent the resultant vector from the sum and difference of two vectors. ● Represent a vector in the plane using a combination of the sum, difference and scalar multiple of other vectors. 3.3 Vectors in two ● Use ordered pair notation (x, y) and column vector notation (x ) to represent a position vector in two dimensions. ● Calculate the magnitude and direction of a vector. • |a| = | ( a1 a2 )| = √ a2 + a2 • tan(𝜃) = y x , x ≠ 0 ● Calculate and use a unit vector, ̂n, in the plane. • ̂n = n |n| ● Define and use unit vectors and the perpendicular unit vectors î and ĵ. ● Express a vector in Cartesian (component) form using the unit vectors î and ĵ. ● Understand and express a vector in the plane in polar form using the(r, 𝜃). ● Convert between Cartesian form and polar form, with and without technology. ● Understand and use the Cartesian form and polar form of a vector.

Scalar quantities have magnitude only; vector quantities have direction as well as magnitude. Most of the quantities that we use are scalar, and include such measurements as temperature (for example 30 °C, 750 K), time, mass, length, surface area, volume, energy, density, speed (e.g. 30 m/s, 300 km/h) etc. For some quantities it is very important that we know both magnitude and direction. Consider the forces involved in Linh and Kim fighting over a stuffed bear. The direction they are pulling is important, as well as how hard they pull the bear. Linh exerts a force of 40 N and Kim exerts a force of 50 N and they apply these forces as shown in the diagram on the right, where the angle between the two forces is 150°. In what direction will the toy move and what is the force in that direction? That is, what is the resultant force, which is the vector sum of these two forces? 50 N 40 N 150° The resultant force depends not only on the size of each force but the direction in which the forces are applied. Consider the two yachts shown in the photograph. Could they be in danger of a collision? One yacht is travelling at a speed of 15 km/h and the other at a speed of 12 km/h. Their speeds give no indication of their direction. Their respective directions are as important as their speed for an analysis their path. Examples of vectors include force, displacement, velocity, acceleration, momentum etc. 112 Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Specialist Mathematics Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition Vectors and scalars A vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction. A scalar is a real number only. 3.2.2 Vector notation A vector is shown graphically as an arrow, or directed line, with a tail (start) and head (end). The length of the line indicates the magnitude and the orientation of the arrow indicates its direction. In the figure, the head of the vector is at point B (indicated with an arrow head), and the tail is at point A. A B When writing this vector, we can use point A to indicate start point, and point B to indicate end point. A special arrow can be used to indicate that it is a vector going from point A to point B: ⃗AB. Some textbooks use a single letter, in bold, such as w, to denote a vector, but this is difficult to write using pen and paper, so w ˜ can also be used. The symbol (~) is called a tilde. Magnitude and direction of a vector The magnitude of a vector is determined by the length of the line segment. The direction is determined by the start point and the end point, or the angle with respect to a fixed line. 3.2.3 Equality of vectors Vectors are defined by both magnitude and direction. Equality of vectors Two vectors are equal if and only if both their magnitude and direction are equal. u ~ v ~ z ~ w ~ In the figure, the following statements can be made: u ˜ = v ˜u ˜ ≠ w ˜ (directions are not equal) u ˜ ≠ z ˜ (magnitudes are not equal). Note: equal vectors do not necessarily need to have the same start points or end points. 3.2.4 Addition of vectors — The triangle rule A B C v ~ u ~ w ~ u ~ v ~+= Consider a vector, u ˜, that measures the travel from A to B and another vector, v ˜, that measures the subsequent travel from B to C. The net result is as if the person travelled directly from A to C (vector w ˜ ). Therefore, we can say that w ˜ = u ˜ + v ˜. CHAPTER 3 Vectors in the plane 113 Addition of vectors To add two vectors, take the tail of one vector and join it to the head of another. The result of this addition is the vector from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector. Returning to Linh and Kim fighting over a stuffed bear, we see that the forces they apply to the toy can be represented as two vectors. The resultant force is the sum of those two vectors. 30° 150° 50 N 40 NResultant force Kim’s force Linh’s force From this figure we are able to get a rough idea of the magnitude and direction of the resultant force. In the following sections, we will learn techniques for calculating the resultant magnitude and direction accurately. 3.2.5 The negative of a vector A Bu~ –u~ If we walk from A to B, and then back from B to A, we have a 0 ˜ net movement. Thus, the vector A to B is the opposite of the vector B to A. If we label vector A to B as u ˜ then the vector B to A must be −u ˜. Subtraction of vectors We can subtract vectors by adding the negative of the second vector to the first vector.

For example, if a vector u ˜ has a direction of north and a magnitude of 10, then the vector 3u ˜ is still in the direction of north and magnitude of 30. If the scalar is negative, then the direction is reversed. Therefore, −2u ˜ has a direction of south and a magnitude of 20. Scalar multiples of a vector are all parallel as multiplication by a positive scalar only affects the magnitude of a vector, and multiplication by a negative scalar affects the vector’s magnitude and reverses its direction.Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Specialist Mathematics Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition WORKED EXAMPLE 4 Representing a scalar multiple of a vector r ~ s ~ Use the vectors shown at right to sketch the result of: a. 2r ˜ + 3s ˜b. 2s ˜ − 4r ˜.

Direction is typically referenced using a compass and expressed as the degrees clockwise from north. This is known as a bearing. We can then use Pythagoras’ theorem and trigonometry to solve displacement and bearing problems through vector addition.

Source: Specialist Mathematics Senior Syllabus 2024 © State of Queensland (QCAA) 2024; licensed under CC BY 4.0 3.3.1 Cartesian form of a vector As a vector has both magnitude and direction, it can be represented in 2-dimensional planes. In the figure, the vector u ˜ joins the point A to point B. There are two main ways of representing this vector: component form and polar form. B A x y u ~ For the component form, using the Cartesian plane, an identical vector can be considered to join the origin with the point C. It is easy to see that u ˜ is made up of two components: one along the x-axis and one parallel to the y-axis. Let î be a vector along the x-axis with magnitude 1. Similarly, let ĵ be a vector along the y-axis with magnitude 1. Vectors î and ĵ are known as unit vectors, and are discussed in section 2.3.5. We can say the vector u ˜ is the position vector of point C relative to the origin. Note: Unit vectors î and ĵ may also be written as î ˜ and ĵ ˜ respectively. C D u ~ x y î ĵ With vectors, it is equivalent to travel along u ˜ from the origin directly to C, or to travel first along the x-axis to D and then parallel to the y-axis to C. In either case we started at the origin and ended up at C. Clearly, then, u ˜ is made up of some multiple of î in the x-direction and some multiple of ĵ in the y-direction. For example, if the point C has coordinates (6, 3) then u ˜ = 6î + 3ĵ. This is the Cartesian form of a vector. O 3 C (6, 3) D u~ 3 y x 6î ĵ CHAPTER 3 Vectors in the plane 123 Cartesian form of a vector The Cartesian form of a vector from the origin to the pointx, y) is given by: u ˜ = xî + yĵ In general, the vector u ˜ = xî + yĵ can be expressed as an ordered pair (x, y) or in column vector notation as (x ). For instance, the vector u ˜ = 6î + 3ĵ can be expressed as an ordered pair (6, 3) or in column vector notation as (6 ). 3.3.2 The magnitude of a vector By using Pythagoras’ theorem on a position vector, we can determine its length, or magnitude. Consider the vector u ˜ shown. The magnitude of u ˜, denoted as |u ˜| , also labelled as r, in polar form, is given by: |u ˜| = √ 62 + 32 = √ 45 = 3√ 5 C (6, 3) u ~ x y 6 3 î ĵ Magnitude of a vector The magnitude of a vector, u ˜ = xî + yĵ, is given by: |u ˜ | = | (x y )| = √ x2 + y2 Note that the calculation does not include î or ĵ under the square root. 3.3.3 The polar form (r, 𝜃) of a vector C (6, 3) u ~ x y \u0000 6î 3ĵĵ From what we already know about trigonometry, we can work out the angle (𝜃) that u ˜ makes with the positive x-axis (that is, anticlockwise from the positive x-axis). This gives us the direction of u ˜. The angle 𝜃 can be calculated as: tan(𝜃) = opposite adjacent = 3 6 124 Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Specialist Mathematics Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition 𝜃 = tan−1 ( 3 6 ) = tan−1(0.5) = 0.464 radians = 26.6° The result obtained by this method needs to be adjusted if the angle is in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th quadrants. This allows us to express the vector in polar form as (3√5, 26.6°) . Direction of a vector The direction of a vector, u ~ = xî + yĵ, anticlockwise from the positive direction of the x-axis is given by 𝜃 = tan −1 ( y x ) , x ≠ 0, Note that when x = 0, the direction of the vector is +90° if y ≥ 0 (direction of the vector is parallel to the positive direction of the y-axis), and −90° if y ≤ 0 (direction of the vector is parallel to the negative direction of the y-axis). To determine the direction of a vector, it might be more convenient to consider |𝜃| as illustrated in the diagram below: I quadrant Direction is given by θ II quadrant y x y x tan(θ) = – ≤ 0, θ ≤ 0 Direction is given by 180° – θ x < 0 y ≤ 0 y xx > 0 y ≥ 0 IV quadrant y xtan(θ) = – ≤ 0, θ ≤ 0 Direction is given by – θ (360°– θ ) III quadrant y xtan(θ) = – ≥ 0, θ ≥ 0 θDirection is given by 180° + θ θ 180° – θ 180° + θ 360° – θ θ θ θ + tan(θ) = – ≥ 0, θ ≥ 0 î ĵ The direction of a vector in the 1 st quadrant is given by |𝜃|, the direction of a vector in the 2nd quadrant is given by 180° − |𝜃| or 𝜋 − |𝜃|, the direction of a vector in the 3rd quadrant is given by 180° + |𝜃| or 𝜋 + |𝜃| and the direction of a vector in the 4 th quadrant is given − |𝜃|. Remember that when x = 0, tan(𝜃) = y x is not defined. If x = 0 and y ≥ 0, then 𝜃 = +90° (direction is parallel to the positive direction of the y-axis) and if x = 0 and y ≤ 0, then 𝜃 = −90° (direction is parallel to the negative direction of the y-axis). Note that to convert between Cartesian and polar forms of a vector, it can be useful to remember the sine and cosine exact values of common angles.

Note that when adding or subtracting vectors, the component (Cartesian) form is more convenient to use. When multiplying a vector by a scalar, both the polar and Cartesian forms are convenient to use. We have seen already that multiplying a vector by a positive scalar affects only its magnitude, but not its direction, whereas multiplying a vector by a negative scalar will reverse its direction (that is, it will add 180° to its direction), in addition to affecting its magnitude. Scalar multiplication of a vector in polar form If u ˜ is a vector of magnitude r and direction 𝜃, and k is a scalar, then ku ˜ = (kr, 𝜃) if k > 0 ku ˜ = (|k|r, 𝜃 + 180°) if k < 0 WORKED EXAMPLE 7 Calculating magnitude and direction of a vector and expressing it in polar form (3, –5) u~ y x\u0000 Using the vector shown, determine: a. the magnitude of u ˜ b. the direction of u ˜ (express the angle with respect to the positive x-axis) c. the expression of u ˜ in polar form. d. the true bearing of u ˜ .

The vectors, î and ĵ are called unit vectors, as they each have a magnitude of 1. This allows us to resolve a vector into its components. Converting from polar to component form If a 2-dimensional vector u ˜ makes an angle of 𝜃 with the positive x-axis and it has a magnitude of r, then we can determine its x- and y-components using the formulas: x = r cos(𝜃) y = r sin(𝜃) WORKED EXAMPLE 8 Determining the components of a vector u~ 310° N S EW y x Consider the vector u ˜ , whose magnitude is 30 and whose bearing (from N) is 310°.
