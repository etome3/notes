One historical example of this is: ‘Since quadratic equations can be solved by a formula, is the same true for cubic equations?’ Mathematicians were able to solve second degree polynomial equations (quadratic equations) in 400 BCE. However, it wasn’t until the early 16th century that progress was made on solving equations involving higher powersx. In 1732 Leonhard Euler devised a general method for solving equations of the type ax3 + bx 2 + cx + d = 0, and soon after Lodovico Ferrari found a general solution to fourth degree equations of the type 4 + bx3 + cx 2 + dx + e = 0. Many important developments in mathematics, engineering, science and medicine have occurred through the use of polynomial functions. Polynomial modelling functions play an important part in solving real-life problems. For example, they are used to design roller coasters, roads, buildings and other structures, and to describe and predict traffic patterns. Economists use polynomial functions to predict growth patterns, medical researchers use them to describe the growth of bacterial colonies, and meteorologists used them to understand weather patterns. 3.1.2 Syllabus links Lesson Lesson title Syllabus links 3.2 Pascal’s triangle and ● Understand the notion of a combination as an unordered set of r objects taken from a set of n distinct objects. ● Recognise and use the link between Pascal’s triangle and the notation (n r ). 3.3 The binomial theorem ● Use the binomial theorem ( x + y)n = xn + (n ) xn−1y + … + (n r ) xn−ryr + … + yn to expand expressions, e.g. (2x − 1)3. 3.4 Polynomials and cubic ● Identify the coefficients and the degree of a polynomial. ● Expand quadratic and cubic polynomials from factors. 3.5 Graphing cubic ● Recognise and determine features of the graphs of y = x3, y = a (x − h) 3 + k and y = a ( x − x1) (x − x2) (x − x3), including shape, intercepts, and behaviour as x → ∞ and x → −∞. ● Sketch the graphs of cubic functions, with or without technology. 3.6 Solving cubic ● Solve cubic equations using technology, and algebraically in cases where the equation is factorised. 3.7 Modelling cubic functions ● Model and solve problems that involve cubic functions, with and without technology.

This expression can be written in shorthand as 7!, which is read as ‘7 factorial’. There is a factorial key on most calculators. Definition n! = n × (n − 1) × (n − 2) × … × 3 × 2 × 1 for any natural number n. It is also necessary to define 0! = 1. 7! is equal to 5040. It can also be expressed in terms of other factorials such as: 7! = 7 × (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) or 7! = 7 × 6 × (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) = 7 × 6! = 7 × 6 × 5! This is useful when working with fractions containing factorials. For example: 7! ✁6! = 7 × ✁6! ✁6! or \u0000\u00005! 7! = \u0000\u00005! 7 × 6 × \u0000\u00005! = 7 = 1 42 By writing the larger factorial in terms of the smaller factorial, the fractions were simplified. Factorial notation is just an abbreviation, so factorials cannot be combined arithmetically. For example, 3! − 2! ≠ 1!. This is verified by evaluating 3! − 2!. 3! − 2! = 3 × 2 × 1 − 2 × 1 = 6 − 2 = 4 ≠ 1 WORKED EXAMPLE 1 Evaluating an expression with factorial notation Evaluate 5! − 3! + 50! 49! . THINK WRITE 1. Expand the two smaller factorials. 5! − 3! + 50! 49! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 − 3 × 2 × 1 + 50! 49! CHAPTER 3 Binomial expansions and cubic functions 91 2.

The number of arrangements is shown in the box table. n n − 1 n − 2 … … … … … … … … … … … … n − r + 1 ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ 1st 2nd 3rd rth object The number of arrangements equals n (n − 1) (n − 2) … (n − r + 1). This can be expressed using factorial notation as: n (n − 1) (n − 2) … (n − r + 1) = n (n − 1) (n − 2) … (n − r + 1) × (n − r) (n − r − 1) × ... 2 × 1 (n − r) (n − r − 1) × ... 2 × 1 = n! (n − r) ! Now consider the situation where order is unimportant. This is the situation where the selection AB is the same as the selection BA. For example, in a mixed doubles tennis match, the entry Alan and Bev is no different to the entry Bev and Alan; they are the same entry. The number of combinations of r objects from a set of n distinct objects is calculated by counting the number of arrangements of the objects r at a time and then dividing that by the number of ways each group of these r objects can rearrange between themselves. This is done in order to cancel out counting these as different selections.Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Mathematical Methods Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition The arrangements of r objects between themselves is shown in the box table. r r − 1 r − 2 ……… 2 1 This can be expressed using factorial notation as: r! = r (r − 1) (r − 2) … .. (2) (1) The number of combinations of r objects from a set of n distinct objects is therefore: ( n! (n − r) ! ) ÷ r! = n! (n − r) ! r! . This symbol for the number of ways of choosing r objects from a total of n objects is nCr or ( n r ). Combinations The number of combinations of r objects from a total of n objects is nCr = n! r! (n − r) ! , 0 ≤ r ≤ n where r and n are non-negative integers. Drawing on that knowledge, we have the following: • nC0 = 1 = nCn, there being only one way to choose none or all of the n objects. • nC1 = n, there being n ways to choose one object from a group of n objects. • nCr = nCn−r, since choosing r objects must leave behind a group of (n − r) objects and vice versa. • 0! = 1, by definition. The formula is always used for calculations to determine the number of combinations or selections. Most calculators have a nCr key to assist with the evaluation when the figures become large. WORKED EXAMPLE 2 Evaluating combinatorial notation Evaluate (8 ). THINK WRITE 1. Apply the formula. (n r ) = n! r! (n − r)! Let n = 8 and r = 3. (8 ) = 8! 3! (8 − 3)! = 8! 3! 5! 2.

The following worked example demonstrates this concept. WORKED EXAMPLE 3 Applying combinations A committee of 5 students is to be chosen from 7 boys and 4 girls. a. Calculate how many committees can be formed. b. Determine how many of the committees contain exactly 2 boys and 3 girls. THINK WRITE a. 1. As there is no restriction, choose the committee from the total number of students. a. There are 11 students in total from whom 5 students are to be chosen. This can be done inC5 ways. 2. Use the formula nCr = n! r! × (n − r) ! to calculate the answer. 11C5 = 11! 5! × (11 − 5)! = 11! 5! × 6! = 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6! 5! × 6! = 11 × ❩❩10 2 × ✘✘✘9 × 8 3 × 7 ✁5 × ✘✘✘✘ 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 462 There are 462 possible committees. b. 1. Select the committee to satisfy the given b. The 2 boys can be chosen from the 7 boys available in 7C2 ways. The 3 girls can be chosen from the 4 girls available in 4C3 ways. 2. Use the multiplication principle to form the total number of committees.: The upper numbers sum to the total available, 7 + 4 = 11, and the lower numbers sum to the number that must be on the committee, 2 + 3 = 5. The total number of committees that contain two boys and three girls is 7C2 × 4C3. 94 Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Mathematical Methods Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition 3. Calculate the answer. 7C2 × 4C3 = 7! 2! × 5! × 4 = 7 × 6 2! × 4 = 21 × 4 = 84 4. Write the answer in context. There are 84 committees possible with the given restriction. 3.2.3 Pascal’s triangle Pascal’s triangle contains many fascinating patterns. Each row from row 1 onwards begins and ends with ‘1’. Each other number along a row is formed by adding the two terms to its left and right from the preceding row. 1Row 0 Row 1 Row 2 Row 3 Row 4 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 The numbers in each row are called binomial coefficients. The number 1 in row 0 is the coefficient of the expansion of (a + b)0. (a + b)0 = 1 The numbers 1, 1 in row 1 are the coefficients of the expansion of (a + b) 1. (a + b) 1 = 1a + 1b The numbers 1, 2, 1 in row 2 are the coefficients of the terms in the expansion of (a + b)2. (a + b) 2 = 1a2 + 2ab + 1b2 The numbers 1, 3, 3, 1 in row 3 are the coefficients of the terms in the expansion of (a + b)3. (a + b)3 = 1a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + 1b3 To expand (a + b) 4 we would use the binomial coefficients 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 from row 4 to obtain: (a + b)4 = 1a4 + 4a3b + 6a2b2 + 4ab3 + 1b4 = a4 + 4a3b + 6a2b2 + 4ab3 + b4 CHAPTER 3 Binomial expansions and cubic functions 95 Notice that the powers of a decrease by 1 as the powers of b increase by 1, with the sum of the powers of a and b always totalling 4 for each term in the expansion of (a + b) 4. For the expansion of (a − b) 4 the signs would alternate: (a − b)4 = a4−4a3b + 6a2b2−4ab3 + b4 By extending Pascal’s triangle, higher powers of such binomial expressions can be expanded. WORKED EXAMPLE 4 Using Pascal’s triangle in binomial expansions Form the rule for the expansion of (a − b) 5 and hence expand (2x − 1) 5. THINK WRITE 1. Choose the row in Pascal’s triangle that contains the required binomial For (a − b)5, the power of the binomial is 5. Therefore, the binomial coefficients are in row 5. The binomial coefficients are:, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1. 2. Write down the required binomial expansion. Alternate the signs:a − b)5 = a5 − 5a4b + 10a3b2 − 10a2b3 + 5ab4 − b5 3. State the values to substitute in place of a and b. To expand (2x − 1)5, a = 2x, b = 1. 4. Write down the expansion. (2x)5 − 5(2x) 4 (1) + 10(2x)3(1)2 − 10(2x) 2(1)3 + 5 (2x) (1) 4 − (1)5 5. Evaluate the coefficients and write the answer. = 32x5 − 5 × 16x 4 + 10 × 8x3 − 10 × 4x2 + 10x − 1 = 32x5 − 80x4 + 80x3 − 40x2 + 10x − 1 ∴ (2x − 1) 5 = 32x5 − 80x4 + 80x3 − 40x 2 + 10x − 1 3.2.4 Formula for binomial coefficients Each of the terms in the rows of Pascal’s triangle can be expressed using factorial notation. For example, row 3 contains the coefficients 1, 3, 3, 1. These can be written as 3! 0! × 3! , 3! 1! × 2! , 3! 2! × 1! , 3! 3! × 0! . (Remember that 0! was defined to equal 1.) The coefficients in row 5 (1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1) can be written as: 5! 0! × 5! , 5! 1! × 4! , 5! 2! × 3! , 5! 3! × 2! , 5! 4! × 1! , 5! 5! × 0! The third term of row 4 would equal 4! 2! × 2! and so on. The (r + 1) th term of row n would equal n! r! × (n − r) ! . This is normally written using the notations nCr or (n ). 96 Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Mathematical Methods Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition These expressions for the binomial coefficients are referred to as combinatoric coefficients. They occur frequently in other branches of mathematics, including probability theory. Combinatoric coefficients (n ) = n! r! (n − r) ! = nCr where r ≤ n and r and n are non-negative whole numbers.

Remember, numbering starts at 0. n = 13 and r = 9 2. Write in nCr notation. The 10th term in row 13 is 13C9 or (13 9 ). 3. Evaluate using formula. (13 9 ) = 13! 9! × 4! = 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × \u0000\u00009! \u0000\u00009! × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 13 × 11 × 10 2 = 715 4. Write the answer. The 10th term in row 13 is 715. 3.2.5 Pascal’s triangle with combinatoric coefficients Pascal’s triangle can now be expressed using this notation.

Note the following patterns: • (n ) = 1 = (n ) (the start and end of each row of Pascal’s triangle) • (n ) = n = ( n n − 1 ) (the second from the start and the second from the end of each row) • (n r ) = ( n n − r ) .

However, for powers n ≥ 7 the calculations can become quite tedious. If a particular term is of interest, forming an expression for the general term of the expansion is an easier option. The general term of the binomial theorem Consider the terms of the expansion: (x + y) n = x n + (n ) xn−1y + (n ) xn−2y2 + … + (n ) xn−ryr + … + yn Term 1: t1 = (n ) xny0 Term 2: t2 = (n ) xn−1y1 Term 3: t3 = (n ) xn−2y2 Following the pattern gives: Term (r + 1): tr+1 = (n ) x n−ryr The general term of the binomial theorem For the expansion of (x + y)n, the general term is tr+1 = (n ) xn−ryr. For the expansion of (x − y)n, the general term can be expressed as tr+1 = (n ) xn−r(−y)r. The general term formula enables a particular term to be evaluated without the need to carry out the full expansion. As there are (n + 1) terms in the expansion, if the middle term is sought, there will be two middle terms if n is odd and one middle term if n is even. WORKED EXAMPLE 8 Determining a term in the binomial expansion Determine the fifth term in the expansion of ( x 2 − y 3 )9. THINK WRITE 1. State the general term formula of the expansion. ( x 2 − y 3 )9 The (r + 1)th term is tr+1 = (n ) ( x 2 )n−r (− y 3 )r.

Choose the value of r for the required term. For the fifth term, t5: r + 1 = 5 r = 4 t5 = (9 ) ( x 2 )9−4 (− y 3 )4 = (9 ) ( x 2 )5 (− y 3 )4 3. Evaluate to obtain the required term. = 126 × x 5 32 × y 4 81 = 7x5y4 144 3.3.3 Identifying a term in the binomial expansion The general term can also be used to determine which term has a specified property, such as the term independent of x or the term containing a particular power of x. WORKED EXAMPLE 9 Determining a particular term Identify which term in the expansion of (3x2 − 4)7 would contain x8 and express the coefficient of x8 as an integer. WRITE 1. Write down the general term for this expansion. (3x2 − 4)7 General term, tr+1 = (7 r ) (3x2)7−r (−4) r 2. Rearrange the general term by grouping numerical parts and algebraic parts together. tr+1 = (7 r ) (3)7−r(−4)r(x2) 7−r = (7 r ) (3)7−r(−4)rx(14−2r) 3. Determine the value of r to form the given power of x. For x 8: 14 − 2r = 8 ∴ r = 3 4. Identify which term is required. Hence, it is the fourth term that contains x8. 5.

LESSON 3.4 Polynomials and cubic functions SYLLABUS LINKS • Identify the coefficients and the degree of a polynomial. • Expand quadratic and cubic polynomials from factors. Source: Mathematical Methods Senior Syllabus 2024 © State of Queensland (QCAA) 2024; licensed under CC BY 4.0. A polynomial is an algebraic expression in which the power of the variable is a positive whole number. For example, 3x2 + 5x − 1 is a quadratic polynomial in the variable x, but 3 x2 + 5x − 1, that is 3x −2 + 5x − 1, is not a polynomial because of the 3x −2 term. Similarly, √ 3x + 5 is a linear polynomial, but 3√ x + 5, that is 3x1 2 + 5, is not a polynomial because the power of the variable x is not a whole number. Note that the coefficients of x, x 2 etc. can be positive or negative integers, or rational or irrational real numbers. 3.4.1 Classification of polynomials • The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable. For example, linear polynomials have degree 1, quadratic polynomials have degree 2 and cubic polynomials have degree 3. • The leading term is the term containing the highest power of the variable. • If the coefficient of the leading term is 1, then the polynomial is said to be monic. • The constant term is the term that does not contain the variable. CHAPTER 3 Binomial expansions and cubic functions 105 General form of a polynomial A polynomial of degree n has the form anxn + an−1xn−1 + ... + a1x + a0 where n ∈ N and the coefficients an, an−1, ... a1, a0 ∈ R. The leading term is anxn and the constant term is a0. WORKED EXAMPLE 10 Classifying polynomials Select the polynomials from the following list of algebraic expressions and for these polynomials, state the degree, the coefficient of the leading term, the constant term and the type of coefficients. 5x3 + 2x2 − 3x + 4A. 5x − x3 + x4 2 B. 4x5 + 2x2 + 7x−3 + 8C. THINK WRITE 1. Check the powers of the variable x in each algebraic expression. A and B are polynomials since all the powers of x are positive integers. C is not a polynomial due to thex−3 term. 2. For polynomial A, state the degree, the coefficient of the leading term and the constant term. Polynomial A: the leading term of 5x 3 + 2x 2 − 3x + 4 is 5x3. Therefore, the degree is 3 and the coefficient of the leading term is 5. The constant term is 4. 3. Classify the coefficients of polynomial A as elements of a subset of R. The coefficients in polynomial A are integers. Therefore, A is a polynomial over Z. 4. For polynomial B, state the degree, the coefficient of the leading term and the constant term. Polynomial B: the leading term of 5x − x 3 + x4 2 is x4 2 . Therefore, the degree is 4 and the coefficient of the leading term is 1 2 . The constant term is 0. 5. Classify the coefficients of polynomial B as elements of a subset of R. The coefficients in polynomial B are rational numbers. Therefore, B is a polynomial over Q. 3.4.2 Polynomial notation • The polynomial in variable x is often referred to as P(x). • The value of the polynomial P(x) when x = a is written as P(a). • P(a) is evaluated by substituting a in place of x in the P(x) expression. WORKED EXAMPLE 11 Evaluating polynomials a. If P(x) = 5x3 + 2x2 − 3x + 4, calculate P(−1). b. If P(x) = ax2 − 2x + 7 and P(4) = 31, obtain the value of a. THINK WRITE a.

Equating coefficients means that if ax2 + bx + c ≡ 2x2 + 5x + 7, then a = 2, b = 5 and c = 7. The identically equal symbol ‘≡’ means the equality holds for all values of x. For convenience, however, we shall replace this symbol with the equality symbol ‘=’ in working steps.

For example, if P(x) = x2 and Q(x) = x3 + x2 − 1, then P(x) + Q(x) = x3 + 2x2 − 1, a polynomial of degree 3; P(x) − Q(x) = −x3 + 1, a polynomial of degree 3; and P(x)Q(x) = x5 + x4 − x 2, a polynomial of degree 5.

Source: Mathematical Methods Senior Syllabus 2024 © State of Queensland (QCAA) 2024; licensed under CC BY 4.0. Cubic functions can be represented in various forms. These include: • y = x3, the simplest cubic function • y = a (x − h) 3 + k, the stationary point of inflection form • y = a (x − x1) (x − x2) (x − x3), the intercept form • y = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, a ≠ 0, the general form. Since a cubic function may have up to three linear factors, its graph may have up to three x-intercepts. The shape of the graph is affected by the number of x-intercepts. CHAPTER 3 Binomial expansions and cubic functions 111 3.5.1 The graph of y = x3 and transformations A x y y = x— (A0 A+ The graph of the simplest cubic function has the equation y = x3. The ‘maxi–min’ point at the origin is sometimes referred to as a ‘saddle point’. Formally, it is called a stationary point of inflection (or inflexion as a variation of spelling). The key features of the graph of y = x3 are as follows: • (0, 0) is a stationary point of inflection. • The shape of the graph changes from concave down to concave up at the stationary point of inflection. • There is only one x-intercept. • As the values of x increase positively, the behaviour of the graph shows that its y-values also increase positively. This means that as x → ∞, y → ∞. This is read as ‘as x approaches infinity, y approaches infinity’. • As the values of x increase negatively, the behaviour of the graph shows that its y-values also increase negatively. This means that as x → −∞, y → −∞. • The graph starts from below the x-axis and increases as x increases. Once the basic shape is known, the graph can be dilated, reflected and translated in much the same way as they = x2. Dilation The graph of y = 4x 3 will be narrower than the graph of y = x3 due to the dilation factor of 4 from the x-axis. Similarly, the graph of y = 1 4 x 3 will be wider than the graph of y = x3 due to the dilation factor of 1 4 from the x-axis or parallel to the y-axis. A x y y = 4x — y = x — y = x—T– 4 Reflection The graph of y = −x3 is the reflection of the graph of y = x3 in the x-axis. For the graph of y = −x 3, note that: • as x → ∞, y → −∞ and as x → −∞, y → ∞ • the graph starts from above the x-axis and decreases as x increases • at (0, 0), the stationary point of inflection, the graph changes from concave up to concave down. Note: Reflection in the y-axis has the same result, y = (−x) 3 = −x3. A x y y = –x — (A0 A+ 112 Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Mathematical Methods Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition Translation The graph of y = x3 + 4 is obtained when the graph of y = x3 is translated vertically upwards by 4 units. The stationary point of inflection is at the(0, 4). The graph of y = (x + 4)3 is obtained when the graph of y = x3 is translated horizontally 4 units to the left. The stationary point of inflection is at the(−4, 0). The transformations from the basic parabola y = x2 are recognisable from the equation y = a(x − h) 2 + k, and the equation of the graph of y = x3 can be transformed to a similar form. A 4 8 x y = (x . 4+ — y = x — . 4 (A0 4+ (–40 A+ y The graph of y = a (x − h)3 + k The key features of the graph of y = a (x − h) 3 + k are as follows: • There is a stationary point of inflection at (h, k). • There is a change of concavity at the stationary point of inflection. • if a > 0, the graph starts below the x-axis and increases, like y = x3. • if a < 0, the graph starts above the x-axis and decreases, like y = −x 3. • The one x-intercept is found by solving a (x − h) 3 + k = 0. • The y-intercept is found by substituting x = 0.

This is the case when the cubic polynomial expressed as the product of a linear factor and a quadratic factor is such that the quadratic factor has two distinct linear factors. This means that the graph of a cubic with an equation of they = a(x − x1)(x − x2)(x − x3) where x1 < x2 < x3 will have the shape of the graph shown. If the graph is reflected in the x-axis, its equation is of the form y = −a(x − x1)(x − x2)(x − x3) and the shape of its graph satisfies the long-term behaviour that as x → ±∞, y → ∓∞. y = a (x – xT+ (x – x–+ (x – x—+ xxT x– x— It is important to note the graph is not a quadratic, so the maximum and minimum turning points do not lie halfway between the x-intercepts. To sketch the graph, it is usually sufficient to identify the- and y-intercepts and to ensure the shape of the graph satisfies the long-term behaviour requirement determined by the sign of the leading term. y = –a (x – xT+ (x – x–+ (x – x—+ xT x– xx— WORKED EXAMPLE 16 Sketching cubics in factorised form Sketch the following without attempting to locate turning points. y = (x − 1)(x − 3)(x + 5)a. y = (x + 1)(2x − 5)(6 − x)b.

One of the x-intercepts must be a turning point. Thinking of the cubic polynomial as the product of a linear and a quadratic factor, for its graph to have two instead of three x-intercepts, the quadratic factor must have two identical factors. Either the factors of the cubic arex − x1)(x − x1)(x − x2) = (x − x1) 2(x − x2) or the factors are (x − x1)(x − x2)(x − x2) = (x − x1)(x − x2)2. The repeated factor identifies the x-intercept that is the turning point. The repeated factor is said to be of multiplicity 2 and the single factor of multiplicity 1. The graph of a cubic polynomial with equation of the form y = (x − x1)2(x − x2) has a turning point on the x-axis at (x1, 0) and a second x-intercept at (x2, 0). The graph is said to touch the x-axis at x = x1 and cut it at x = x2. Although the turning point on the x-axis must be identified when sketching the graph, there will be a second turning point that cannot yet be located without technology. 116 Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Mathematical Methods Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition WORKED EXAMPLE 17 Sketching cubics with two intercepts or repeated factors Sketch the graphs of the following. y = 1 4 (x − 2) 2(x + 5)a. y = −2(x + 1)(x + 4)2 b.

Source: Mathematical Methods Senior Syllabus 2024 © State of Queensland (QCAA) 2024; licensed under CC BY 4.0. Practical situations that use cubic polynomials as models are likely to require a restriction of the possible values the variable may take. This is called a domain restriction. The domain is the set of possible values of the variable that the polynomial may take. We shall look more closely at domains in other chapters. 3.7.1 Maximum and minimum values and cubic models Similar methods to modelling with linear and quadratic relationships are used when using cubic polynomials, with the polynomial model expressed in terms of one variable. In setting up equations: • define the symbols used for the variables, specifying units where appropriate • ensure any units used are consistent and lengths of objects are positive • determine the links between the variables • check whether mathematical solutions are feasible in the context of the problem • express answers in the context of the problem. Applications of cubic models where a maximum or minimum value of the model is sought will require identification of turning point coordinates. In a later chapter we will see how this is done. For now, obtaining turning points may require the use of graphing or other technology. WORKED EXAMPLE 23 Determining cubic models A rectangular storage container is designed to have an open top and a square base. The base has side length x cm and the height of the container is h cm.

Write the given information as an equation connecting the two variables. a. The sum of the dimensions is 48 cm.+ x + h = 48 h = 48 − 2x b. Use the result from part a to express the volume in terms of one variable and prove the required b. The formula for the volume of a cuboid is V = lwh ∴ V = x2h Substitute h = 48 − 2x. V = x2(48 − 2x) ∴ V = 48x2 − 2x 3, as required c. State the restrictions.: It could be argued that the restriction is 0 < x < 24 because when x = 0 or x = 24 there is no storage container, but we are adopting the closed convention. c. Length cannot be negative, so x ≥ 0. Height cannot be negative, so h ≥ 0. 48 − 2x ≥ 0 −2x ≥ −48 ∴ x ≤ 24 Hence, the restriction is 0 ≤ x ≤ 24. d. Draw the cubic graph but only show the section of the graph for which the restriction applies. Label the axes with the appropriate symbols and label the given turning point. d. V = 48x2 − 2x = 2x2(24 − x) x-intercepts: let V = 0. x2 = 0 or 24 − x = 0 ∴ x = 0 (touch), x = 24 (cut) (0, 0), (24, 0) are the x-intercepts. This is a negative cubic.
