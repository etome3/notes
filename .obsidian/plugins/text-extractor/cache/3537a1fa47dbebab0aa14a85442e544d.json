{"path":"Literature/Term 2/Assessment/Proposal Marked.pdf","text":"Bremer State High School Year 11 Literature Student: Teacher: Proposal for monologue. Character selected Fleance Setting 1920’s Prohibition-era Chicago A cold, damp alleyway behind a speakeasy, shortly after escaping the hit on his father. Where in the plot of the original text will the monologue fit in? For example, before Act4, Scene 2 where Lady Macduff is killed. Immediately after the equivalent of Act 3, Scene 3 where Banquo (his father, a key mob figure) is assassinated and Fleance barely escapes. What happens in the plot prior to your monologue’s positioning in the text? Original: Macbeth has become king after murdering Duncan. He's paranoid about Banquo and the witches' prophecy about Banquo's sons. He orders Banquo and Fleance to be murdered. Banquo is killed. New: Macbeth (a ruthless gangster) has seized control of the \"family\" after killing the previous Don (Duncan). He's worried about Banquo (a respected enforcer/capo, his former partner) and the \"whispers\" (prophecy equivalent) that Banquo's son, Fleance, might one day take over or avenge him. Macbeth orders a hit on Banquo and Fleance. Banquo is killed. What happens in the plot following it? Original: Macbeth sees Banquo's ghost at the banquet. The witches give more prophecies. Macduff goes to England. Macbeth becomes more tyrannical. New: Fleance goes into hiding. Macbeth becomes increasingly paranoid and violent, perhaps seeing \"ghosts\" of his actions (figuratively or literally, if we want to play with guilt). He solidifies his power but alienates allies. Other mob families or internal dissenters (Macduff) start to plot against him. Fleance will seeks to survive, gather allies, and eventually avenge his father and reclaim what he sees as his family's due. Bremer State High School Year 11 Literature Do you plan to reinterpret the character or the representations of concepts, identities, times and places from the original play? If the latter, identify the concept. Primarily reinterpreting the character of Fleance by giving him agency and voice immediately after trauma, rather than him just disappearing for a while. Also reinterpreting concepts like kingship (mob boss), prophecy (street rumours/fortune tellers), loyalty and betrayal within the criminal underworld. Reinterpreting time and place significantly, going from feudal Scotland to 1920’s Chicago. How will you reinterpret the character or concept, identity, time, or place from the base text? Fleance: From a boy who mostly flees to a young man grappling with immediate grief, terror, and a dawning understanding of the brutal world he's in. Kingship -> Mob Boss: Power gained through violence and fear, not divine right. Prophecy -> Rumours/Omens: Less supernatural, more about the psychology of belief and self-fulfilling prophecies in a superstitious environment. Feudal Scotland -> Prohibition Chicago: Retains the themes of ambition, violence, and precarious power, but in a more modern, urban, and recognizable criminal setting. How will you set your monologue in a different context to the original play? In this new interpretation – a 1920s Prohibition-era Chicago crime syndicate – the language will be different (colloquialisms of the era), the immediate dangers different (gunmen, not swordsmen), and the motivations are rooted in a different social structure (crime family vs. feudal kingdom). Bremer State High School Year 11 Literature How do you plan to invite the audience to question or reflect on the dominant cultural assumptions, attitudes, values and beliefs that underpin the original play and/or the new cultural context? The original play explores themes of legitimate rule (Divine Right) versus tyranny, and the corrupting nature of ambition. In the 1920s gangster context, 'legitimate rule' is absent, power is explicitly through violence. The monologue will invite reflection on: • Whether ambition is inherently destructive, or if it is the context that shapes its outcome. • If the 'prophecy' or 'rumour' simply gives individuals an excuse for actions they already desired.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
