{"path":"Ancient History/Term 2/Alexander/Attachments/Assassination aftermath and Alexander's consolidation 13.png","text":"narrated by Diodorus Siculus and all the historians who used Cleitarchus. According to the sixteenth book of Diodorus' history, ™! Pausanias (of Orestis) had been a lover of Philip, but became jealous when Philip turned his attention to a younger man, also called Pausanias. The elder Pausanias’s taunting of the new lover caused the youth (the younger Pausanias) to throw away his life, which turned his friend Attalus against the elder Pausanias. Attalus took his revenge by inviting Pausanias to dinner, getting him drunk, then subjecting him to sexual assault. When Pausanias complained to Philip, the king felt unable to chastise Attalus, as he was about to send him to Asia Jwith Parmenion, to establish a bridgehead for his planned invasion. He also married Attalus's niece, or daughter, Eurydice (Our family tree shows Eurydice to be a niece). Rather than offend Attalus, Philip tried to mollify Pausanias by elevating him within the bodyguard. Pausanias' desire for revenge seems to have tuned towards the man who had failed to avenge his damaged honour, so he planned to kill Philip. Some time after the alleged rape, while Attalus was already in Asia fighting the Persians, he put his plan in action.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"eng"}
