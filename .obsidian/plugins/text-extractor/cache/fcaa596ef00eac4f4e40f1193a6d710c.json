On average, ho wever, the attractive in teractio n s do min ate. Figure : Bo th Attractive an d Rep ulsive Dip o le–Dip o le In teractio n s Occur in a Liq uid Samp le with Man y Mo lecules Because each en d o f a dip o le p o ssesses o n ly a fractio n o f the charge o f an electro n , dip o le–dip o le in teractio n s are substan tially weaker than the in teractio n s between two io n s, each o f which has a charge o f at least ±1 , o r between a dip o le an d an io n , in which o n e o f the sp ecies has at least a full p o sitive o r n egative charge. In additio n , the attractive in teractio n between dip o les falls o ff much mo re rap idly with in creasin g distan ce than do the io n –io n in teractio n s. Recall that the attractive en ergy between two io n s is p ro p o rtio n al to 1 /r , where r is the distan ce between the io n s. Do ublin g the distan ce (r → 2 r ) decreases the attractive en ergy by o n e- half. In co n trast, the en ergy o f the in teractio n o f two dip o les is p ro p o rtio n al to 1 /r , so do ublin g the distan ce between the dip o les decreases the stren gth o f the in teractio n by 2 , o r 8 -fo ld.

Co mp o un ds with higher mo lar masses an d that are p o lar will have the highest bo ilin g p o in ts. Solution: The three co mp o un ds have essen tially the same mo lar mass (5 8 –6 0 g/mo l), so we must lo o k at differen ces in p o larity to p redict the stren gth o f the in termo lecular dip o le–dip o le in teractio n s an d thus the bo ilin g p o in ts o f the co mp o un ds.

As a result, the C–O bo n d dip o les p artially rein fo rce o n e an o ther an d gen erate a sign ifican t dip o le mo men t that sho uld give a mo derately high bo ilin g p o in t.

Thus we p redict the fo llo win g o rder o f bo ilin g p o in ts: 2 -methylp r o p a n e < ethyl methyl ether < a ceto n e.

What kin d o f attractive fo rces can exist between n o n p o lar mo lecules o r ato ms? This q uestio n was an swered by Fritz Lo n do n (1 9 0 0 –1 9 5 4 ), a German p hysicist who later wo rked in the Un ited States.

On average, the two electro n s in each He ato m are un ifo rmly distributed aro un d the n ucleus. Because the electro n s are in co n stan t mo tio n , ho wever, their distributio n in o n e ato m is likely to be asymmetrical at an y given in stan t, resultin g in an in stan tan eo us dip o le mo men t. As sho wn in p art (a) in Figure , the in stan tan eo us dip o le mo men t o n o n e ato m can in teract with the electro n s in an adjacen t ato m, p ullin g them to ward the p o sitive en d o f the in stan tan eo us dip o le o r rep ellin g them fro m the n egative en d. The n et effect is that the first ato m causes the temp o rary fo rmatio n o f a dip o le, called an in duced dip o le, in the seco n d. In teractio n s between these temp o rary dip o les cause ato ms to be attracted to o n e an o ther. These attractive in teractio n s are weak an d fall o ff rap idly with in creasin g distan ce. Lo n do n was able to sho w with q uan tum mechan ics that the attractive en ergy between mo lecules due to temp o rary dip o le–in duced dip o le in teractio n s falls o ff as 1 /r . Do ublin g the distan ce therefo re decreases the attractive en ergy by 2 , o r 6 4 -fo ld. Figure : In stan tan eo us Dip o le Mo men ts.

In stan tan eo us dip o le–in duced dip o le in teractio n s between n o n p o lar mo lecules can p ro duce in termo lecular attractio n s just as they p ro duce in terato mic attractio n s in mo n ato mic substan ces like Xe. This effect, illustrated fo r two H mo lecules in p art (b) in Figure , ten ds to beco me mo re p ro n o un ced as ato mic an d mo lecular masses in crease (Table ).

The reaso n fo r this tren d is that the stren gth o f Lo n do n disp ersio n fo rces is related to the ease with which the electro n distributio n in a given ato m can be p erturbed. In small ato ms such as He, the two 1 s electro n s are held clo se to the n ucleus in a very small vo lume, an d electro n –electro n rep ulsio n s are stro n g en o ugh to p reven t sign ifican t asymmetry in their distributio n . In larger ato ms such as Xe, ho wever, the o uter electro n s are much less stro n gly attracted to the n ucleus because o f filled in terven in g shells. As a result, it is relatively easy to temp o rarily defo rm the electro n distributio n to gen erate an in stan tan eo us o r in duced dip o le. The ease o f defo rmatio n o f the electro n distributio n in an ato m o r mo lecule is called its p o larizability. Because the electro n distributio n is mo re easily p erturbed in large, heavy sp ecies than in small, light sp ecies, we say that heavier substan ces ten d to be much mo re p o la r iza b le than lighter o n es. Fo r s imila r s ub s ta n ces , L o n do n dis p er s io n fo r ces get s tr o n ger with in cr ea s in g mo lecula r s ize. The p o larizability o f a substan ce also determin es ho w it in teracts with io n s an d sp ecies that p o ssess p erman en t dip o les. Thus Lo n do n disp ersio n fo rces are resp o n sible fo r the gen eral tren d to ward higher bo ilin g p o in ts with in creased mo lecular mass an d greater surface area in a ho mo lo go us series o f co mp o un ds, such as the alkan es (p art (a) in Figure ).

As a result, the bo ilin g p o in t o f n eo p en tan e (9 .5 °C) is mo re than 2 5 °C lo wer than the bo ilin g p o in t o f n - p en tan e (3 6 .1 °C).

Co n seq uen tly, H–O, H–N, an d H–F bo n ds have very large bo n d dip o les that can in teract stro n gly with o n e an o ther.

To p redict the relative bo ilin g p o in ts o f the o ther co mp o un ds, we must co n sider their p o larity (fo r dip o le–dip o le in teractio n s), their ability to fo rm hydro gen bo n ds, an d their mo lar mass (fo r Lo n do n disp ersio n fo rces). Helium is n o n p o lar an d by far the lightest, so it sho uld have the lo west bo ilin g p o in t.

Ethan o l, CH CH OH, an d metho xymethan e, CH OCH , are structural iso mers with the same mo lecular fo rmula, C H O.

Ho wever, ethan o l has a hydro gen ato m attached directly to an o xygen - an d that o xygen still has exactly the same two lo n e p airs as in a water mo lecule. Hydro gen bo n din g can o ccur between ethan o l mo lecules, altho ugh n o t as effectively as in water. The hydro gen bo n din g is limited by the fact that there is o n ly o n e hydro gen in each ethan o l mo lecule with sufficien t + charge.

Donors and Acceptors In o rder fo r a hydro gen bo n d to o ccur there must be bo th a hydro gen do n o r an d an accep to r p resen t. The do n o r in a hydro gen bo n d is the ato m to which the hydro gen ato m p articip atin g in the hydro gen bo n d is co valen tly bo n ded, an d is usually a stro n gly electro n egative ato m such as N,O, o r F.

Sin ce the hydro gen do n o r is stro n gly electro n egative, it p ulls the co valen tly bo n ded electro n p air clo ser to its n ucleus, an d away fro m the hydro gen ato m.

Properties and ef fects of hydrogen bonds On Boiling Point When we co n sider the bo ilin g p o in ts o f mo lecules, we usually exp ect mo lecules with larger mo lar masses to have higher n o rmal bo ilin g p o in ts than mo lecules with smaller mo lar masses. This, witho ut takin g hydro gen bo n ds in to acco un t, is due to greater disp ersio n fo rces (see In teractio n s Between No n p o lar Mo lecules).
