FIA2 Technique Student Experiment Unit Unit 1: Chemical fundamentals – structure, properties and reactions Topic Topic 3: Chemical reactions – reactants, products and energy change Conditions Duration 10 hours class time Mode Written response — Scientific Report Length 1500 – 2000 words Individual/ group Group work with individual report Other May work collaboratively to develop methodology and perform experiment. All other elements are individual work. Resources available School library (online: internet and school intranet, databases, journals) Context You have completed the following experiment:  Enthalpy of combustion for burning foods Task Modify (i.e. refine, extend or redirect) an experiment in order to address your own related hypothesis or question. You may use a practical performed in class, a related simulation or another practical related to Unit 1 (as negotiated with your teacher) as the basis for your methodology and research question. Page 2 of 5 To complete this task, you must:  identify an experiment to modify*  develop a research question to be investigated*  research relevant background scientific information to inform the modification of the research question and methodology  conduct a risk assessment and account for risks in the methodology*  conduct the experiment*  collect relevant qualitative data and/or quantitative data to address the research question*  process and present the data appropriately  analyse the evidence to identify trends, patterns or relationships  analyse the evidence to identify uncertainty and limitations  interpret the evidence to draw conclusion/s to the research question  evaluate the reliability and validity of the experimental process  suggest possible improvements and/or extensions to the experiment  communicate findings in an appropriate scientific genre, i.e. scientific report. *The steps indicated with an asterisk above may be completed in groups. All other elements must be completed individually. Stimulus — Checkpoints ☐ Week 5 Lesson 1 – Research Question ☐ Week 6 Lesson 1 – Rationale ☐ Week 7 Lesson 1 – Analysis of Data ☐ Week 9 Thursday – Full draft due before 9:00am Assessment objective/s 1. Describe ideas and findings about properties and structure of atoms and materials, and chemical reactions in terms of reactants, products and energy change. 2. Apply understanding of properties and structure of atoms and materials, and chemical reactions in terms of reactants, products and energy change. 3. Analyse data about properties and structure of atoms and materials, and chemical reactions in terms of reactants, products and energy change. 4. Interpret evidence about properties and structure of atoms and materials, and chemical reactions in terms of reactants, products and energy change. 5. Evaluate processes, claims and conclusions about properties and structure of atoms and materials, and chemical reactions in terms of reactants, products and energy change. 6. Investigate phenomena associated with properties and structure of atoms and materials, and chemical reactions in terms of reactants, products and energy change. Feedback 20 / 20 Page 3 of 5 Authentication strategies  The teacher will provide class time for task completion.  Students will provide documentation of their progress at indicated checkpoints.  The teacher will collect and annotate drafts.  The teacher will conduct interviews or consultations with each student as they develop the response.  Students will use plagiarism-detection software at submission of the response.  Students must acknowledge all sources.  The teacher will provide class time for task completion.  Students will provide documentation of their progress at indicated checkpoints. Scaffolding The response must be presented using an appropriate scientific genre (i.e. scientific report) and contain:  a research question  a rationale for the experiment  reference to the initial experiment and identification and justification of modifications to the methodology  raw and processed qualitative data and/or quantitative data  analysis of the evidence  conclusion/s based on the interpretation of the evidence  an evaluation of the methodology and suggestions of improvements and extensions to the experiment  a reference list. An example of how one of the practicals could be modified to develop a research question: Practical that will be modified: Electrolysis of water (simulation). Research question: How does changing the concentration of the electrolyte (KOH) affect the time to produce 25 mL of hydrogen gas by electrolysis? Developing the research question: Steps Details Identify the independent variable to be investigated. Concentration of KOH (electrolyte). Identify the dependent variable. Time to produce 25 mL hydrogen gas. Identify the methodology to be used. Electrolysis. Draft research questions. How can the concentration change the amount of hydrogen gas produced? How can the addition of an acid or base act as an electrolyte to make hydrogen? Refine and focus the research question. Can a change in concentration of a basic electrolyte affect the time to make hydrogen gas? Present research question to teacher for approval. How does changing the concentration of the electrolyte (KOH) affect the time to produce 25 mL of hydrogen gas by electrolysis?
