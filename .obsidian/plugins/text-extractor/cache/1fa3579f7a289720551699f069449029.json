Calculate formal charges Determine the number of valence electrons in the molecule by adding the valence electrons for each atom minus the charge. Atom A Sum Atom B Charge Determine the central atom. Usually this is the most electronegative element or the atom that can form the greatest number of bonds. It is usually not hydrogen or a halogen. Place this atom at the centre and connect all other atoms using single bonds. Add lone pair electrons to the terminal atoms (not the central one) until they have a full octet or there are no more electrons left to distribute - count electrons from Step 1. If there are electrons left over, allocate them to the central Follow the octet rule - aim for 8 electrons for each element. Remember that bonds contain 2 electrons. Calculate the formal charge for each individual atom in the Lewis structure. Formal charge = Number of valence electrons - Number of bonds - Number of lone pair electrons Aiming for a formal charge of 0, or as close to 0 as possible. Lewis Structures 1.
