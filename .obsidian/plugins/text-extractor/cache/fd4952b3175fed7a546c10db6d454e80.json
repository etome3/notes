{"path":"Tomes Eden-11K-7042383422M.pdf","text":"The information contained in this report is a summary of your child’s achievement, effort and behaviour in the subjects, courses and/or vocational education and training studied this reporting period. This report is one of several strategies used by our school to communicate with you throughout the year. Parent-teacher interviews are offered to discuss your child’s progress. On request from a parent or carer, the school can provide a comparison of the student’s level of achievement in each learning area and/or subject against the achievements of other students in the school, in the same year level who undertook the learning area and/or subject—whilst maintaining the privacy of individual students. Reporting on achievement, effort and behaviour Your child’s achievement in General, General (Extension), Applied, Applied (Essential) subjects and/or Short Courses is reported using an A–E scale, using the subject-specific reporting standards found in the relevant syllabus.
