{"path":"Literature/Term 1/jasper jones movie script.pdf","text":"Scripts.com Jasper Jones By Shaun Grant Page 1/37 1 Careful. You're dripping juice on Spider-Man. The thing about Spider-Man is that he'd be useless in a place like Corrigan. How do you mean? There's nothing for him to swing in between here. He needs an urban environment. That's why Superman is the greatest superhero. He's all-terrain. Superman? He's the worst superhero. Excuse me? Superman is boring. He's invulnerable. That's why they invented kryptonite, so he has some kind of weakness. Batman, he's the best superhero, because, well, he's just a guy like me or you. He doesn't have any superpowers. He's not superhuman. He has a cape and a mask and arch-enemies. He's a superhero, no question. You're not listening, Chuck. Batman does not possess superpowers. Therefore he's not super. You've lost your mind. Batman is a master of martial arts. He's a detective, he's an inventor. And given that 'super' only means 'greater than normal', by that definition, Batman can only be described as a superhero. You still here, Jeffrey? Go home, or your parents will think we've stolen you. Page 2/37 I was about to leave in disgust. You have a very irritating son, Mrs Bucktin. Why, thank you, Jeffrey. He's been spitting pips all over your tablecloth. Oh, you little bugger! Oh, Charlie! \"Courage is resistance to fear,\" \"mastery of fear, not absence of fear.\" Bed. Merry Christmas. Goodnight. Charlie. Charlie. It's Jasper. - Who? - Jasper Jones. What are you doing here? I need your help. Me? Why me? Come with me. I'll show you. Where? Hurry up, Charlie. We've got to go. I'm right. Didn't hurt. - Come on. Follow me. Why would Jasper Jones ask for my help? He's never even spoken to me before. Jasper! Where are we going? People in town say he's dangerous. But I've always wondered what he's really like. I don't know where he's taking me. Or why I followed him. And I don't know how I'm gonna find my way back home. I can trust you. Page 3/37 - Right, Charlie? - Trust me with what? Shh! Shh! Shh! I didn't do it! I swear I didn't do it. I found her. I found her here tonight. Charlie, I need your help. Help me. Who is it? It's Laura. Wishart? Eliza's sister? Yeah. I shouldn't be here. We have to tell the police. No. No, we can't. Why not? Because they'll see that she's been knocked around. That this is my place. That that's my rope! They're gonna say it's me. Jasper, they're the police. They won't. Won't they? Who'd you blame first? Who did you blame first?! I can't tell them the truth. This is Corrigan. Nobody will believe me. But I thought you might. 'Cause you're an outsider like me. And you're smart. Please, Charlie. Help me. I think I know who did it. Who? Mad Jack Lionel. What, you think? Been walking past his place for years. Sometimes I hear him calling out Page 4/37 my name. Waving like a lunatic. He's seen me with Laura too. What are you doing? We have to hide her. Jasper, we're not detectives. We can't just solve this on our own. We don't have a choice. You think I want this? Nobody can know. Nobody. Not until we find out who did this. Help me. She's still warm. Please, Charlie. Grab the rock. Charlie? Charlie! Charlie! - I'm up! I'm awake! - Get up, or the bin gets your breakfast! As the Apollo 12 astronauts head back to earth from the moon... You alright, Charlie? You feeling a bit crook? Charlie? I'm fine. What happened to your face? I cut myself. Sleeping? - Looks like a shaving cut. - Don't be ridiculous. Is that what happened? Leave him. He's embarrassed. I'll teach you how to do that properly later, mate. The boy's growing up, Ruthie. Well, if you're not eating, I suggest you head over to Jeffrey's. He's been around three times already this morning. Page 5/37 You know what I don't understand? Mermaids. Chuck! - Chuck! - What?! Mermaids. Why are they considered so sexy? What are you talking about? It's because of their... their... Their boobies? Sure, but they're half a fish. You can deep-fry the lower part of their body and that would be delicious. OK, hypothetical time. Would you rather have a magnetic head or fart out of your mouth? Chuck? Chuck! Try this one. Would you rather have a hat made of spiders or have penises for fingers? So you're choosing the penis fingers, then? I'm avoiding the question entirely. It's too stupid even by your standards. - I've got the bat, man. - Nice line there, son. Jeffrey, don't take the new ball. No worries, Chuck. Yeah, good line. Just need to work on the length. Pitch it up. Pitch it up to him. Watch the footwork there! Eye on the ball! - Oh, fuck off, Cong! - Oh, shit. Give it here. Page 6/37 Yeah, cheers, Cong. I'll have that. Actually, no, you can have it. No, Cong, just take it. Cong, I'm giving it to you. Actually, you know what? You can have my shit ball. Good on you! - Yeah, Warwick! - God, he's hopeless. Why does he always show up here? Why are we at Mad Jack Lionel's? Well, you think it's true? What? That he murdered someone? Of course it is. Everybody knows. Knows what? He came back from the war deranged. He got addicted to killing. And that's why he worked at the abattoir. That's where it all happened. What happened? They reckon that he shot a woman and dragged her back there. They said that he hung her up and bled her out. - Hung her up? - That's what they say. How... how do I not know this? 'Cause you're an idiot. Come on! Ward Austin! Jackie Weaver... You will find out on Personality Squares! Find out what you can. And don't say anything to anyone. I'll be back as soon as I can. Oh, hello, Maureen. Page 7/37 Yeah, yeah, we are, but it's fine. No. No, I haven't. Oh, my goodness. Really? Oh. That's awful. Well, I mean... Gwen must be beside herself. Yeah, yeah, of course. No. No, I appreciate the call. Yeah, thank you, Maureen. Yes, I will. OK. Bye. Charlie? - Could you knock? - If you go to Jeffrey's tomorrow, I want you to stay on the street so I can see you. - Why? Because I said so. Has something happened? Not anything that's a concern of yours. But something has happened? Not anything that's a concern of yours. Is someone in trouble? Yes. You, if you don't stop giving me the third degree. Now, please, just do as I ask tomorrow. Thank you. And clean up this room. Just joking. It's... pretty neat. Ah. Eliza Wishart. - Your book has come in. - Thank you. It's just under... here. OK. Ah. Page 8/37 Here it is. Thank you. Charlie, wait. I'll be out in a second. Sign there. \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" Have you read it? Me neither. I've seen the film three times, but Mum won't let me buy the book. So I got Mr Daglish to order it for me. I told Mr Daglish \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" is a book about a girl who's famous for making omelettes. I don't think he's read a book written this century. Have you seen the film? Audrey Hepburn is perfect. She's so pretty and dignified. I wish I was Holly Golightly in my own apartment in Manhattan. I would love that too. Well, you could be Paul. He lives next door. He's a writer. - That's what I want to be. - Really? Well, that's perfect. We can go to the New York Public Library together and sign a copy of your book. There's so many policemen in town. You haven't heard? Heard what? It's because of my sister. What happened? She's gone missing. I didn't know. Do they know where she might have gone? They don't know anything. I need you to take this. Page 9/37 Quick. Promise you won't read it before me, OK? - OK. - Just keep it safe. Stupid, stupid little girl! Where have you been? I was meeting Charlie at the library. I told Dad before I left. Don't tell me lies! Come with me, now! I told you to stay in the street! Calm down. Don't you tell me to calm down, Charles Bucktin! Where were you? - At Jeffrey's. - Don't... Don't lie to me! I was just at the library. This is 'your' fault. This obsession with books. What did I say to you last night? I said stay in the street where I can see you. - Ruth, come on, love... - No! Don't undermine me. This is important. There is a girl missing! Do you understand? Laura Wishart, Gwen's girl. No-one's seen her since Christmas Day. Anything could have happened to her. And that is why I asked you to stay close by! - I didn't know. - Yeah, of course you didn't know! Because as much as you would like to think of yourself as Errol Flynn, you're still a boy! The snow upon the sleigh is falling Page 10/37 Christmas in the air Santa's here Hear the sleighbells ring as we ride... ...sleighbells ring loud and clear Hear them ring from the depths of the valley... Hi, Jude. Chuck, pick a card. Pick a card. Just put them away. Everyone's attention, please. Quieten down. Thank you. Firstly, I'd like to thank you all for turning out this evening in response to what are some very concerning circumstances. As many of you are aware, Laura Wishart, the daughter of our shire president, Pete, and his wife, Gwen, has not been seen since Christmas Day. So, tomorrow, with the assistance of the West Australian Police Force, we will be conducting a district-wide search, and we are asking that any of you who can spare the time to please volunteer. Now, the muster point will be here at 5:30 am. Spotter planes will be in operation and dive teams will be combing the river. Furthermore, all residents who are under the age of 18 must remain in their homes after sunset. At this point, Page 11/37 I'd like to hand over to Pete Wishart to say a few words. It has to be magic. I told you. Good evening. It means a great deal to us to... see so many of you here tonight. It's particularly humbling to see Brian and Sue Findlay in attendance, having tragically lost their boy Danny in Vietnam overnight. Now, I think I can speak for the whole town when I say that our thoughts and our prayers are with you both. At this time of year, we're all reminded of the importance of family and the value of community, but... it's never been more clear to me than it is right now, and I just want to thank each and every one of you for all your words of compassion and support. Now, if any of you have any information that might assist us in finding Laura, please, just come forward. - I'm not hungry. - Here you go. I am. Your boy doing alright, eh? Stuffing his face like a pig! Is your boy alright? 'Cause mine isn't. Mine's dead. My boy's dead! No, no, no. Page 12/37 No more, please. Your mother's staying here to help pack up the hall. Nobody helped Mrs Lu. They just watched. Thanks, Susan. I'll see you tomorrow. Yes. I know. Let's get home. Even the police saw what happened and Miss Findlay can just walk away? Yes, I know. Just keep it down. - Mrs Lu didn't hurt anyone. - I know. Let's talk about this when we get home, alright? - Goodnight, Peter. - Wesley. Come on, Charlie. What do you think happened? Truthfully... before tonight, I would have thought the most logical likelihood is that she's run away. I've taught Laura for a few years now and... she's a bit remote. Wouldn't surprise me if she'd skipped town for the city, and I hope I'm right. But... But? I shouldn't be telling you this... but when they searched her room, the window was wide open and everything was a mess. And there was blood on the floor and on her bed. So, I don't know. It's very concerning. Page 13/37 Which is why there's such a serious response. Do they have any suspects? No, not really. Although, I have heard talk that they're looking for Jasper Jones. Wh-Why? Because they blame that poor kid for everything. Wait. What are you working on in there? In here? Well, I'm learning the bassoon. What? Yeah, that's right. Do you want to hear me play? Ooh. Sounds like more of a trumpet. Yeah, well, like I said, I'm just learning. Goodnight, mate. Charlie! Jasper, where have you been? - What happened at the town hall? - They're looking for you. I know. They've been staking out my old man's place for the past two days. Can you come out? But there's a curfew on. Wait a second. Come on. The lights are on. He might be home. Jasper, there's no way I'm going in there. We're not going in. Just watching. It's... not my brand. Come on. What is it? Um... it's Pelham's. Page 14/37 I think it's Irish. Nicked it from my old man. He goes through it so fast, doesn't notice when it's missing. Are you worried he'll tell the police where you are? He wouldn't have a clue. After my mum died... he just went to shit. Well, when did she die? When I was real young. Car crash. I don't remember her at all. I haven't even seen a photograph. But I know she's where I get my colour from. Her people aren't from round here. Did you love her? Laura? We were planning to leave together. When? As soon as we could. That's why I've been gone these past couple of months. Been out Donnybrook way picking stone fruit. Didn't get a chance to tell Laura. Well, why not? There wasn't time. I couldn't go near her house during the day. Think of that. I could only ever see her when it was dark. It's like she was a dream or something. I came back Christmas night... with enough money to get us out. Went straight to her window... Page 15/37 and she was gone. And then you came here. I heard her screaming. And then I found her. I never should have left. I should have stayed here. It's not your fault. Enough people blame you already. Someone else did this. I let her down. Is that why you wrote that? What? On the tree. What does it say? Uh... - You wrote it, didn't you? - What does it say?! It says \"sorry\". - You mean you didn't write it? - No. Then who did? It had to be... it had to be Mad Jack. He's been back here. Last night. What if he's here, Jasper?! Jasper, he could be right now! He could be here. We have to go. - No, Charlie. Wait. - I'm leaving! Charlie, wait! Wait. I want to go with you. Close that door. You stay right where you are. - But why? I want to help. - You can help by staying home and safe. You listen to your mother. Alright, come on. Come here. Come here. Get inside. Come here. Come here. I'm going to Jeffrey's. Alright. Come on, boy! Page 16/37 Come on, then! Come here, you little mongrel! Hey! Charlie! Hi. Uh, h-hi. I just came to renew the loan on my book. My bag. What? Actually, uh... that's not true at all. I've been waiting around here the past couple of days hoping I might see you. What? Charlie, are you alright? I'm fine. Completely fine. Nothing. It's... Is that a knife? No. I mean... I mean, yes, it is, but it's not. Did you maybe want to walk me home again? I can't. Really? I'm sorry, I have to go. Speaking of good times, here come the Easybeats. Everybody shake Everybody groove Mmm-Mmm Mmm-Mmm-Mmm-Mmm... Oh! Oh, mama Yeah, Mary, Mary, you're on my mind The folks are gone and the place will be mine... Ha-ha! Mary, Mary, wanna be with you... Page 17/37 And this is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put a call... What happened? Did they find anything? No. Nothing. Not even a trace. Jesus Christ, that poor girl. Jesus, Jasper, what happened? The sarge. The prick kicked me in the ear. It's still ringing. Sarge? I didn't think they'd ever let you go. They didn't. So, how did you get out? Tricked one of the city coppers. Told him I had to take a shit, went straight out the window. - That's amazing. - Yeah. They'll be looking for me harder than ever now. I have to show you something. Look. Look, it's the same as the tree. \"Sorry\". It says \"sorry\". What are you doing?! Jasper! Mmm. Yeah. Nah, it's OK. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! My bag! - What? - He's got my bag! Eliza's book. It was a bug! Who's there? Who's there?! Hey! Page 18/37 Aarggh! Charlie! - Hey! - Jasper! Get out of here, you little bastards! I know you did it! I know you did it! Jasper?! We have to go back. He did it. He killed her. I know, but you can't even stand. We have to go back. We have to. Not now. What about New Year's Eve? When everyone's at the fireworks, we can go back then. Promise? I promise. Stay here. Charlie Bucktin. What are you doing here? Hmm? Get in the car. Come on. Oh! We didn't do anything wrong. - Hmm? - I didn't do anything. Oh! Thank goodness! I thought I'd lost you! Are you alright? Oh, God! Get inside. - Come on, inside. - Jesus, Chuck. - Inside. - Are you alright? Well, where were you?! We were worried about you! Now... Hey! Page 19/37 You said, \"We didn't do anything wrong.\" Now, who's \"we\"? Nobody. Do you think I'm playing with you, son? Hmm? Who were you with? Charlie. Tell the truth. Uh... Eliza. - Wishart? - Yes. Why? Because I was worried about her. I... I just wanted to make sure she was alright. We're... we're fond of each other. \"Fond of each other\"? Did you ever stop to consider that maybe the last thing the Wishart family needs right now is a young man prowling around their home? - Hmm? - No, sir. I'm sorry. Sorry? So am I. We're done. 'Night, Romeo. We appreciate you bringing him home. Now, Charlie, I think you need to get to bed and stay there. What, that's it? No wonder he thinks he can cavort around town whenever he feels like it! Ruth, he's growing up. You were slipping out to go dancing with the G.I.'s at his age. That is completely irrelevant! He could have died, Wesley! We don't know who's out there! Page 20/37 I agree. But screaming at him isn't gonna reinforce the point. What's your solution? Do nothing? Just disappear in there and write a bloody story about it? Wes Bucktin, the disappearing man! You know, some of us can't just shut the door and avoid living here! Oh, Jesus Christ! Are you two ever gonna listen to me?! I am fed up! Fed up! Now, I love you, Charles Bucktin, and I am glad you're alive, but tomorrow, you're gonna wish you weren't! Now, get out of my sight! Now. Dig. What? Why? Because I said so! - How deep? - I'll tell you when to stop. Chop chop! I didn't say you could stop. What is this even for? I don't understand why I'm doing this. Well, I don't understand you at all, Charlie Bucktin. One minute you're avoiding me like I'm contagious, the next you're telling people we're sneaking out at night together because we're romantically attached. You know, it's polite to ask a girl first. - I can explain. - Um, no. Excuse me. This is not on. Page 21/37 I just came to get something back. Well, it can wait. Charlie's working very hard at the moment. Let him finish up, thank you. Go on. Does your mother know you're traipsing around town on your own? I think you should be at home right now, don't you? Right. You can stop. Oh, no, you don't. I want you to fill it in. - What? - Fill it in. I don't want some dirty great big hole in my backyard. If you didn't want a hole, then why did you ask for it? There you are, you've learnt your lesson. Now, I'm heading out, and I want this filled in by the time I get back, or you'll be doing it all again tomorrow, young man. - What's this? - I bought myself a car! Isn't she a beauty?! I don't understand, Ruth. You want to s... do you want to sell the Holden? 'Cause I'll need to get Ernie Banks to replace the crankshaft. It's stuffed! No, I don't want you to sell the Holden, Wesley. Then... So... who wants to come for a spin? Charlie. Charlie, you'll need to get cleaned up. Have you filled the hole in? Page 22/37 Fine. I'll go by myself. Here you are, mate. You get inside. Go on. Jesus, Dad! How are you doing? I'm tickety-boo. Had a great day. Why would she make me do it? I should have buried her in there. Mate, you scared her last night. You're a smart kid, but what you did was colossally stupid. Today was... just her way of telling you all that. And I don't blame her. So, whenever she gets back, I... think you should offer her a sincere apology. You want me to apologise?! Yes. You should consider yourself lucky that you've got a mother that cares about you so very much. A lot of people never get that. So, do you want me to make us some dinner? Haven't I been punished enough? You're just like her, your mother. You're peas in a pod, you two. Go, Corrigan! Good turnout today. It's a beautiful day. Where have you been? The game's almost over. We're getting thumped! - Why are you padded up? - I'm in next. - What?! Page 23/37 - I'm in next. I'm playing, officially. Jeffrey Lu on debut. How? David Doe rolled his ankle, so I'm in the 11. Yes! - So you're actually gonna bat? - Sure am. We need 60 runs in a hurry. Jesus, Jeffrey. Are you nervous? No. But you should be. Have you seen your girlfriend up there? So, go read her some poetry. I need to focus. This town needs a hero. Go on, go! Sassy time! - Shot! - Very nice. I was hoping you might be here. Really? Why? May I sit? What are you reading? Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Is it good? You know, Alice really has an awful time. She's so lost and nobody helps her. They're all so mean and selfish. Sounds like \"Charlie's Adventures in Corrigan.\" Eliza's too. You know, the annoying thing is I still kind of wish you had come over. Really? Our house is so... empty. I'm sorry. I'm not a good person, Charlie. Don't say that. You're wonderful. Page 24/37 I'm not. I'm really not. I might have already used it, but... Would you rather have a hat made of spiders or penises for fingers? Are the spiders alive? Yes, and they're poisonous and angry. Well... I'm gonna have to go with the penis fingers. Wise choice. You too? So, where were you really that night? That's out. That's Jeffrey! He's actually gonna bat! Hmm? They never pick him. This is it. This is his chance. Hey, look at that. Oh! You don't belong on this field, mate. We're going home. There's no point. Oh, let's go home. Hopeless. See you, Marge. Look at them. They're leaving already. You don't belong here, Cong. - Come on. - Come on, Will. He shouldn't even be here. That's hilarious! Come on, Jeffrey. Go on, Will. Ooh! Shot! Come on, Jeffrey. - Four runs. - Beautiful! Page 25/37 Four runs. Unbelievable! We can win this. How many points do we need? - Runs. - How many runs do we need? A lot. He's seeding them like a watermelon! - You little ripper! - Well done! Well done! There's two balls left. We need four to win. OK. Here's what we do... No worries. He's going to do it. He's gonna beat them. Just take your time, son. Oh, that's got to be a wide! - Come on, ump! - Oh, come on, ump! It's the last ball. He has to, he just has to. Stumps! Win to Corrigan! - What a champion! - Go, Jeffrey! Yes! Jeffrey! Yeah, Jeffrey! Charlie, would you really sneak out to meet me? I would. Then how about tomorrow night? At the New Year's Eve fair? During the fireworks? And bring my book. It's really important. - It's your turn. Come on. - Anytime this week, Charles. I know. Hurry up. - Already? - Again? Page 26/37 I'll add 'em up, Boys. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. I never understood that whole shooting fish in a barrel. Just why not drain them out? Why bring guns into it? Oh, never underestimate a man's dumb desire to shoot at something, love. Do you think Mad Jack Lionel shot someone? Why would you ask that? I don't know. I ju... Do you think he has something to do with Laura Wishart's disappearance? What's that? Get out here! - Get out here, you rat! - Come on! Stay here. Stay inside. I'll call Sarge. You don't want to fight this war on our turf, do you mate? Stay here, Charlie. You coward! Eh? Yellow-skinned bastard! - Hey, you two! What are you doing? Hey, stop it! Get out of my yard, you bastards! What'd you call me? You... Enough! Leave him alone! - No, no, Jeffrey! - Let me go! - Want some more, eh?! - That is enough! - Fuck off, Bucktin! - Stop it! That's enough. Page 27/37 Stop it! - Stop it, please! - Weak as piss! You know there's a fucking war on?! Oh! Pull your heads in! You should be ashamed of yourselves! You fucking red rats! Clear out of here! Go on! Charlie! Charlie, watch yourself! - Are you alright, An? - I'm OK. Thank you so much. Charlie, I told you to stay inside! Come in, son. This is what I've been working on. This is my novel. I'm almost finished. And I want you to be the first. The first to read it. Would you do that for me, son? I'd be proud to. - You're a good man. Now, go back to bed. Ooh. Made a mess of the agapanthus... An? Excuse me, An. It's very, very nice of you. Thank you. - Sorry about last night. - We are OK. They are helping, you know, to fix the fence. What are you doing? See, while you're out smooching girls, some of us are honing our skills to keep... the streets safe. Page 28/37 Are you coming to the fireworks tonight? Nah. Just going to stay here. Well, besides... the two biggest fireworks in town are right here anyway. I am one of the true masters, Chuck. - I was thinking about it, and I know why Batman is the greatest superhero. - He's not. But why? Courage. - What? You see, Superman doesn't need courage to stand in front of a bullet because it can't possibly harm him. But Batman, on the other hand, he has more to lose. He has to overcome his fears to save people. Give me the right to your heart May we never part... - OK, now, don't go too far. - OK, Mum. Just give me your love... You ready? Jasper, wait. What are we gonna do? We're gonna talk to the man. What?! He has a gun, Jasper. This is crazy! Lionel! - Jasper! - Jack Lionel! Jasper, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Can we have a word? Yeah, come on up. Page 29/37 G'day. Who's this, then? Sit down. Jasper. What are you doing? Sit down! Alright, mate. Alright, alright. Alright. Now, just... just... just be careful. I know what you did. Oh. So, you admit it? You admit you killed her?! Yeah. I wanted to... come and see you, but... your dad would have never allowed. What's my old man got to do with this?! Well, he's... he's never forgiven me and he never will. Forgive you for what? For Laura?! Laura? No, your mum's name was Rosie. You mention my mother again and I'll put one in your head! Jasper, don't! What about the woman at the abattoir? What woman at the abattoir? After the war, when you worked there. You hung her up like Laura. No, son, I'm not... I'm not following you at all. When you... when you wrote \"sorry\" on the car out there, you... Yes? You have no idea who I am, do you? Yeah, I do. You killed Laura Wishart! Page 30/37 Mate, I don't even know who she is. Sit down! Son, maybe you can help us. You... go and grab that picture up there. Show it to Jasper. Take a look. You take a look. See, that there's Rosie. She's your mum. Yeah? She's holding 'you', mate. You recognise your dad? Yeah? See, he's my son. Bullshit! Jasper, he's your grandfather. Liar! You fucking liar! - No, Jasper, don't. - Step back! Jasper, you can do as you wish with that firearm, but... will you listen to me first, please? There's something you need to know. Something I'm ashamed of. But I've got to tell you. Alright? Mate, I disowned your dad when he married your mum. That's why he took her name, you see? Jones. That's why he's never been back here, not even once. But after your grandmother passed away, ' my wife' after she died, Rosie started driving around here to look after me and to cook for me. That's when I realised how wrong I'd been about her. I'd been so wrong about her. Yeah, we used to sit together for hours sometimes. Page 31/37 I adored her. But then one day, mate, she, um... she was suddenly in a lot of pain and she was grabbing at her sides and she was gasping. She collapsed. I had to pick her up. I got her up and I got her into the car. And she was screaming. And I panicked. And, uh... I drove too fast, mate. I just drove much too fast. We hit a patch of gravel. And she died. I killed her. I always wanted to say how sorry I... am. I'm just so sorry. Jasper, I... Just go! - What are you doing?! - Charlie! - You don't say a thing, you understand? - Shut up! What are you doing here?! You shouldn't be here. No, you shouldn't be here! No, no, no. It's not what you think... Do not touch me! We are going home! You do not get to tell me what to do! And you, you should be doing your job! Charlie! Oh, shit! Eliza, I'm sorry. Everything is a mess. Where were you?! Eliza... Page 32/37 Why can't you ever answer me? Why can't you just tell me the truth? Just go home, Charlie. Eliza, wait. Wait. You've got to come with me. There are some things I need to tell you. About Laura. I know where she is. What? Please come out. I-I can make it right. I'll show you. Come on. It's through here. Charlie, how do you know? I'll explain everything. I have to show you. Eliza... I have to tell you something about Laura. She's dead. She died right here. I know. It's my fault. What's she doing here?! - You know him? - That's what I wanted to say. Why'd you bring her here?! I've been here before. What? Jasper, she knows. - You told her? - No! I know everything. Except why you left my sister. How could you? She loved you. - I didn't leave her! - Yes, you did. Charlie, did you bring my book? Yes. Page 33/37 Right here. It's for you. Charlie? \"Jasper Jones,\" \"You came to my window\" \"and you were gentle and you were kind.\" \"But then you didn't come anymore.\" \"You came to my window and you saved me,\" \"because the nights you didn't, my father came to my door...\" \"and he wasn't gentle, he wasn't kind.\" \"He betrayed me again and again.\" \"And now that betrayal lives...\" \"and now that betrayal lives and grows inside me.\" \"I can't forgive him\" \"and I can't forgive you.\" \"You promised we would leave together.\" \"Now I have to leave on my own.\" - On that night, my father pushed his way in. She was yelling and he kept telling her to be quiet, but she wouldn't. And then he hit her. And she kept screaming and screaming, and... and then he was yelling too, and then everything went silent. Later, I heard her sneaking out. I followed her... all the way here. I saw her climb up... and sit on that branch for a long time. And she just... seemed really calm. I should have stopped her. Then she just dropped. Page 34/37 I ran to her, but I was too late. Then I heard someone coming. So I picked up the letter and ran back home. I came back the next night, but she was gone. Where is she? What have you done with her? - Jasper! - What is he doing? Jasper, stop! Laura. Laura... So, you wrote \"sorry\"? - Yes. I should have helped her. - Well, we have to tell someone. We can't trust Sarge. But there has to be someone. Eliza? Has he ever...? No. She can't do that! Charlie, you have to go. Charlie, you have to go now. Eliza, wait. I'll see you soon. What do you want? What are you doing here, Charlie? I need to talk to you. It's about Eliza. I'm worried about her. I just... Sarge. The Wishart place is on fire. It's gonna have to wait. Alright? OK. Charlie, wait. Please. Come on. Where have you been? And you're leaving? I had a long talk Page 35/37 with your dad, and... we decided it's best if, um... if I just stay up in the city for a while. Good. Charlie... I just need to explain... I am so sorry. What I've done is just... it's disgraceful and you should never have had to... Oh, God. You're growing up so fast. What happened to my little boy? You've got your whole life ahead of you, all you kids. You're so free. You know, when I first heard that Laura Wishart might have run away... I was jealous. That's an awful thing to say, but I just... it's how I feel. I love you... so much. And I love your father. I just can't be in this place anymore. I know. God! It's gonna be alright?
