Behaviour of real gases is complicated. The ideal gas assumptions are suitable for modelling gases at higher temperatures and lower pressures. Model starts to fail at low temperatures and at high pressures. Ideal Gases - Assumptions: Pressure is a measure of force per unit area For a gas, pressure is a measure of the average number of collisions per unit time 1 kPa = 1000 Pa Atmospheres (atm) 1 atm = 101.3 kPa Millimetres of Mercury (mmHg) 1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa 1 kPa = 7.5 mmHg All gas molecules display the same behaviour. No diﬀerences arise from diﬀerent molecules / chemical nature (i.e. O2, H2, Cl2, and CO2 gas would all display the same behaviour). 1 Kinetic Theory of Gases Ideal Gases - Conditions Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP) Standard Laboratory Conditions (SLC) Room Temperature and Pressure (RTP) Boyle’s Law Gas molecules do not interact with each other – intermolecular forces are negligible. 2 The volume of gas particles is negligible compared to the volume taken up by the gas. 3 A gas consists of small particles (atoms or molecules) that move randomly with rapid velocities. Gas molecules moving in all directions at high speeds cause a gas to ﬁll the entire volume of a container. 1 Intermolecular forces between gas particles are negligible. Gas particles move far apart and will expand to ﬁll a container of any size and shape. 2 The actual volume occupied by gas molecules is very small. Most of the volume of a gas is empty space, which allows gases to be compressed. 3 The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature (in Kelvin). Gas particles move faster as the temperature increases, hitting the walls of the container with more force and producing higher pressures. 4 Gas particles move in straight paths until colliding with other gas particles or with the walls of the container to bounce oﬀ elastically in other directions. An increase in either the frequency or force of collisions against the walls of the container causes an increase in the gas pressure. 5 STP = 273 K (0oC) and 100 kPa, 22.4 L/mol SLC = 298 K and 100 kPa, 24.8 L/mol RTP = 298 K and 1 atm, 24.0 L/mol Inverse relationship between volume and pressure. As volume increases, pressure decreases. When temperature and moles are constant. V~1~P~1~ = V~2~P~2~ Boyle’s Law Practice Questions: Charles’ Law Proportional relationship between temperature and volume. As temperature increases, volume also increases. If a gas at 25.0 °C occupies 3.60 liters at a pressure of 1.00 atm, what will be its volume at a pressure of 2.50 atm? 1.44 L 1 A gas occupies 12.3 liters at a pressure of 40.0 mmHg. What is the volume when the pressure is increased to 60.0 mmHg? 8.2 L 2 A gas occupies 1.56 L at 1.00 atm. What will be the volume of this gas if the pressure is increased to 3.00 atm? 0.52 L 3 Two bulbs of diﬀerent volumes are separated by a valve. The valve between the 2.00 L bulb, in which the gas pressure is 1.00 atm, and the 3.00 L bulb, in which the gas pressure is 1.50 atm, is opened. What is the ﬁnal pressure in the two bulbs, the temperature being constant and the same in both bulbs? 1.3 atm 4 When pressure and moles are constant. V~1~/T~1~ = V~2~/T~2~ Charles’ Law Practice Questions: Avogadro’s Law Proportional relationship between moles and volume. As number of moles increase, volume also increases.

V~1~/n~1~ = V~2~/n~2~ Avogadro’s Law Practice Questions: Ideal Gas Law PV = nRT Where: P = Pressure (kPa) V = Volume (L) 5.00 L of a gas is known to contain 0.965 mol. If the amount of gas is increased to 1.80 mol, calculate the new volume (at constant temperature and pressure). 1 A cylinder with a movable piston contains 2.00 g of helium (He) at 298 K. More helium was added to the cylinder and the volume was adjusted so that the gas pressure remained the same. Calculate the mass of helium that was added to the cylinder if the volume was changed from 2.00 L to 2.70 L at constant temperature. Give your answer in grams. 2 At a certain temperature and pressure, one mole of diatomic H2 gas occupies a volume of 20 L.
