FIA2 Technique Investigation – Independent source investigation Unit Unit 1: Investigating the Ancient World Topic 2: Features of Ancient Societies Conditions Duration 4 weeks Mode Written Length Up to 2000 words Individual/ group Individual Other • Direct quotes are included in the word length unless cited for authentication purposes (e.g. direct quotes presented alongside the source analysis). • the interrogation of evidence from historical sources may be in the form of bullet points, but the critical summary must be in the form of paragraph/s. • Students can develop their responses in class time and their own time. Resources available Access to library and electronic resources Context Throughout the unit you have been examining how ancient societies reflect the attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of ancient peoples. As part of this inquiry, you have considered how the beliefs, rituals, and funerary practices of several exemplar civilisations, providing insight into the broader attitudes and culture of the peoples of each period. You have also developed your conceptual understanding of the reliability and usefulness of sources, historical interpretations, representations and perspectives, the nature of evidence, and the contestability of sources, and how to demonstrate these understandings in Independent Source Investigation responses. Task Your task is to complete an independent source investigation on the beliefs, rituals and funerary practices of one ancient civilisation from the following: • Old Kingdom Egypt (3rd to 6th Dynasty) • Israel and Judah (961–586 BCE) • Archaic Greece (900–600 BCE) • Roman society (753–133 BCE) • Persian society (559–330 BCE) • Spartan society (c. 700–371 BCE) • Indian society in the Mauryan Empire (321–181 BCE) • Ptolemaic Egypt (331–31 BCE) • Ancient China in the Qin and Han Dynasties (221 BCE – 220 CE) • The Early Christians (to 337 CE) • The Celts (1200 BCE – 60 CE) • The Vikings (700–1100 CE) • A society or time period other than those suggested, on the basis that there are sufficient sources available for an independent source investigation. Alternative options must be approved by your teacher. To complete this task, you must: Present the results of your investigation in the form of a rationale, source analysis and a critical summary of evidence. The response will include evidence of: • identifying, locating, and organising sources that have not been studied or supplied in class (a combined total of 4–6 sources, including primary and secondary, that demonstrate different perspectives) • devising a student-driven key inquiry question and 3–5 sub-questions • creating a rationale (with a paragraph structure) that explains the thinking behind their topic, e.g. topic choice, origins of their questions, possible hypothesis, choice of sources • developing a source analysis where emphasis is given to analysing the origin, purpose and context of historical evidence, and evaluating historical sources and evidence to show understanding of perspectives and interpretations. These can be in dot points. However, accepted standard language conventions apply • creating a critical summary of evidence reflecting on decisions, judgments and/or conclusions • practising ethical scholarship by using a recognised referencing system to acknowledge sources (including a reference list in APA formatting). Checkpoints Checkpoints ☐Term 2, Week 2: Ancient civilisation selected; General research completed; Inquiry questions completed ☐Term 2, Week 3: Sources identified and located; responses begun ☐Term 2, Week 4: Sources identified and located; 2-3 source responses completed ☐Term 2, Week 5: Full draft submitted by 9am on Friday 23rd of May, including critical summary ☐Term 2, Week 7: Final submission by 9am on Friday 6th of June Authentication strategies • You will be provided class time for task completion. • Your teacher will observe you completing work in class. • Your teacher will collect copies of your response and monitor at key junctures. • You must acknowledge all sources. • Your teacher will collect and annotate a draft. • Your teacher will conduct interviews or consultations as you develop the response. • Your teacher will ensure class cross-marking occurs. • You will use Turnitin to submit your response. Scaffolding Identifying and locating sources (4 - 6 sources): When identifying and locating sources consider the following resources: • Academic journals (which can be accessed online through databased such as: ProQuest, JSTOR etc.) • Textbooks and historical non-fiction texts • Online historical sites and encyclopaedias. Examples include: o Ancient History Sourcebook: https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/ancient/asbook.asp o JSTOR https://www.jstor.org/ o Ancient History Encyclopaedia: https://www.ancient.eu/ o Livius: http://www.livius.org/ • Remember to locate both primary and secondary sources that offer differing perspectives. Devising inquiry questions (1 key question and 3-5 sub-questions): When devising historical questions for research, you should: • develop questions that elicit information pertaining to: definitions of key terms and concepts; backgrounds, changes and continuities; effects interests and arguments; reflections and responses • consider the complexities within the research generated from these questions • maintain a record of this research process. Analysing and evaluating evidence to show understanding and make judgements: When analysing and evaluating your sources, you must: • identify the key features of the source, which may include: origin, motive, audience, perspective, context, explicit meanings and implicit meanings. • interpret the significance of these features and identify what it reveals about the civilisation they are from; • evaluate the reliability, usefulness and contestability of the source • make well-reasoned and corroborated judgments about the different perspectives, representations and interpretations evident in the sources; Creating a critical summary of the evidence: When creating a critical summary of the evidence you must reflect on: • the decisions and judgments that you made; • any conclusions that you have drawn from the sources and what they reveal about your civilisation.
