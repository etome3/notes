X:\\Common\\ASSIGNMENT GUIDE\\Assignment Writing Guide v2010 v2.doc Page 4 of 21 BBrreemmeerr AAsssseessssmmeenntt PPoolliiccyy CONTEXT In 2004 the Queensland Studies Authority (QSA) provided a statement to schools giving advice about late and non-submission of assessment. (Memo 043/04) The intent of the QSA is to maintain:  fairness to all students across the state, and  results that reflect the standards in the syllabuses. The statement encouraged schools to devise their own policies, using QSA guidelines, on how to manage late and non-submission of assessment items. A second assessment memo that guides our policy is Memo 091/04. HOW BREMER HELPS MINIMISE LATE AND NON-COMPLETION OF ASSESSMENT  Advance Notice Advance notice of assignments/due dates is provided to all students via a course outline for each subject including assessment details. This is provided at the beginning of the semester.  Making tasks due “the week beginning…” rather than a single set date  Giving Special Consideration Across More Than One Subject Students can negotiate (usually required before the due date) with the Administration or Guidance Officers to be granted special consideration based on extreme personal or family crisis, ill health or accident and previously identified individual learning styles. The task still needs to be done but changes can be made to the time allowed and its style or format.  Giving Extensions and Special Consideration at the Single Subject Level Students can also negotiate extensions of time for an assessment item with the Head of Department of the relevant subject. Negotiations need to be completed before the beginning of the week that the task is due. The Head of Department will also need to see some work already done on the task.  Monitoring Progress Teachers of classes use a variety of strategies to document students’ progress while they work on a task so that they can make judgements about achievement. These include: giving set dates for drafts, including sign-off sections, making mark book notes, breaking large assignments into small sections. A BREMER STUDENT’S RESPONSIBILITY Students need to  check and record dates for all assessment tasks  ask for special consideration or extensions before the week work is due; keep teachers and Heads of Departments informed if there is a problem  submit or perform drafts or sections of the task at the times set down  hand in or demonstrate the final product by start of the last scheduled lesson in the week due. X:\\Common\\ASSIGNMENT GUIDE\\Assignment Writing Guide v2010 v2.doc Page 5 of 21 POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES ON NON SUBMISSION OF ASSESSMENT If, through non-submission of assessment, students do not provide evidence to demonstrate the descriptors stated in exit criteria and standards in a syllabus, they could lose credit for a semester. When Assessment is not completed by the due date the student will be required to sit for the alternative assessment at a time determined by the relevant Head of Department. The conditions of assessment may be changed. If substantial amounts of work have not been completed in a subject, students could lose results for that subject completely and this will affect the information contained on the Senior Certificate and OP scores. This decision is made by the Principal.

ASSIGNMENTS DEFINITION An ASSIGNMENT is any student work that necessarily involves some out of school time or some in-school independent research and /or study by students (and is part of an assessment program). It does not include regular practice type homework set in subjects such as Mathematics. Assignments may include practical, oral, creative or written work. RESOURCES: Resources for the assignment will be accessible to all students through subject teacher, subject area or the school’s resource centre. Students in Years 10-12 should make every effort to access other outside resources. Year 8 & 9 are encouraged to make effort to access other resources. These resources should inform the bibliographic referencing. ADVICE TO STUDENTS: The Assignment Topic, objectives, instructions including length, illustrations, due date and criteria for marking will be given to the students in writing. Advice and guidance will be available from teachers throughout the period of the assignment, including class time as allotted by the teacher. DUE DATE: Assignments are scheduled to be completed in a specified week. In practice the final time for written assignments becomes the start of the last scheduled lesson for the class in the week the assessment is due. For Oral Assessment a written draft of their oral presentation is due at the start of the first lesson of the week. All assignments, complete or incomplete, must be handed in / performed on the due date unless an extension has been negotiated in advance of the due date with the HOD and teacher. HANDING IN: The Assignment must be handed to the teacher personally. It must not be handed to another teacher or left on a table for a teacher. The assignment should be handed to the Head of Department in the absence of the regular class teacher. All rough draft work should be included if appropriate or required. Assignments must be submitted in hard copy form unless specifically required in a different format. Some subjects may also require the submission of draft / notes. A written record of date and time of submission may be kept by each department. STUDENT ABSENCE ON THE DUE DATE: Students absent from school on the day an assignment is due should arrange to have the assignment delivered to the school on time. Where this is not done, the procedures for LATE ASSIGNMENTS will apply. If delivery is impossible, parent phone contact with the PRINCIPAL or DEPUTY PRINCIPAL is required on the day of absence. X:\\Common\\ASSIGNMENT GUIDE\\Assignment Writing Guide v2010 v2.doc Page 7 of 21 STUDENTS’ OWN WORK: Assignments must be a student’s own work. Teachers may require to view the student’s work at various stages prior to the completion of the assignment. From time to time the school may require certification that the work presented is the student’s own work. All assignments involving some research must include a bibliography. We use the Harvard style. (Copies at our library or http://www.library.uq.edu.au/training/citation/harvard_6.pdf ) USE OF COMPUTERS: Possible computer failure should be allowed for in the student’s planning. Computer/printer malfunction is not an acceptable reason for non-submission on the due date. To minimise any possible problems, students should try to use compatible programs at school and home and make multiple copies of work in progress. Students having problems printing out assignments at home may overcome that problem by bringing disks to school and accessing the school system or by emailing to school.projects@bremershs.qld.edu.au. If email is used it is the student’s responsibility to check that it has arrived within the timeframe required of all students. EXAMINATIONS Please note that the above procedures also apply to examinations. Should a student be absent for an exam, parental contact on the day is essential and the student will still need to complete the assessment task upon his/her return. An absence from an exam/assessment due to illness is best supported by a medical certificate. If advance warning of an absence is known, consultation with the Head of Department or Senior Member of Administration e.g. Principal or Deputy Principal must occur. Note the QSA guidelines also apply here and failure to sit examinations may mean that credit for the subject is denied. APPEALS In any areas under this policy where there is a failure to reach agreement between students and school representatives appeals may be made to Heads of Department or to the Principal.

It involves finding out information from sources listed and/or from other sources in the library, including electronic databases and the internet. 2. It involves the study of that information with the aim of solving a problem, answering a question, completing an exercise or drawing conclusions in an extended piece of writing. 3 . The length of that writing will be specified. 4. You will be given several weeks in which to complete the assignment, usually in your own time. 5. Some class time may be used to develop the necessary skills to write the assignment and to provide criteria by which the assignment will be assessed. Writing the Assignment In setting an assignment or project, your teachers expect that you will use it as opportunity to do some independent reading, writing and investigation. Expectations will be that you: 1. have gathered information that is relevant to the topic set. 2. have thought about and understood the material used. 3. will show your skills in drawing conclusions about the question or exercise. Assessment When the assignment is presented to you by the teacher, it will be accompanied by a criteria sheet which will set out exactly what is required in order to obtain a good result. Your work will be assessed according to how well you have met the criteria. Early planning will assist you meet deadlines and gives you the best opportunity to get good results. You are advised not to spend an excessive amount of time on the cover page or the decorative or illustrative aspects of the assignment, except where this was specifically asked for. Planning the Assignment Define the Problem - Determine what the question requires you to do Some common terms and their different shades of meaning: Analyse: consider the various components of the whole and try to describe the inter- relationship between them Compare: examine the characteristics of the objects in question with the view to demonstrating their similarities and their differences. Contrast: examine the characteristics of the objects in questions for the purpose of demonstrating differences. Define: give a definition or state the terms of reference. Describe: give an account of Discuss: present the different aspects of a question or problem. Enumerate: give a listing. Evaluate: examine the various sides of a question and try to reach a judgement. Examine critically: act as a judge or critic, appraise. Illustrate: give an example, explain, draw a figure. Justify: give a reasoned explanation, based on evidence. Prove: demonstrate or show by logical argument. Summarise: examine the main points briefly. X:\\Common\\ASSIGNMENT GUIDE\\Assignment Writing Guide v2010 v2.doc Page 9 of 21 Limit the Problem A problem is not limited by omitting information, leaving out essential details or presenting only part of the evidence. A problem is limited by reducing the scope of the investigation. For example:- Rather than tackle “Birds of Australia” investigate “Birds of the Ipswich Region”. A Time Schedule A suggested allocation of time: 1. Breaking down the task defining and limiting the problem, planning the assignment. 20% 2. Consulting source material and collecting information 40% 3. First Draft 20% 4. Revising, referencing, writing the final draft, proofreading 20% N.B: Remember to take into account the possibility of computer Network failure and/or home computer problems. Consulting Source Material A suggested list of references is often included by your teacher with set assignments. Why? Otherwise, you should check library resources, including the information provided by the librarians on the intranet. As well as books from the non-fiction shelves, remember to consult encyclopedias, yearbooks, periodical articles, newspaper articles and computer programmes. assessment.  Guidelines is the periodical index in book format. It is held in the Library magazine section.  Internet: Library subscribes to Library Webs, which is a collection of quality websites.  CD roms in Library.  Digital Library – a gateway to online resources relevant to Bremer students.  Electric Library – access to newspaper articles, magazines, maps, pictures and transcripts.  E-library Science – access to articles via electronic database (has relevance beyond science)  Periodical indexes available via Internet for members of Ipswich Library. In your application for Computer Network access you agreed to: 1. Back up important information (assignments) on a disk at the end of each computer session. 2. Endeavour to complete assignments a few days ahead of schedule to allow for Computer Network failure. 3. Not use Network failure as an excuse for late assignments. If you do have computer problems, you must hand in a disk on the due date. Include information about the program/s you used. Printing by the school will be charged to your account. X:\\Common\\ASSIGNMENT GUIDE\\Assignment Writing Guide v2010 v2.doc Page 10 of 21 PPllaannnniinngg yyoouurr RReesseeaarrcchh When you are preparing for and conducting research, it helps to break the process into a number of steps, as shown below. You can also access worksheets that help you during the various phases of research from the Library Website, from the page titled Assignments. Additionally poster resources are provided throughout our Library that further assist your preparation. You are encouraged to talk and work with the teacher–librarian as you prepare. Attending to the following steps will help you gather information and also will assist the development of information literacy. Steps 1. Read the assignment as provided to you, circling any words or phrases whose meaning is unclear to you. Check for the meaning with your teacher and peers. Underline any words which you think are keywords, or especially important to this assignment. 2. Do some initial background reading to develop your knowledge of the area being studied. 3. Write the assignment out in your own words. Be careful to include all the important points. 4. Write out 3 to 5 questions, which you need to answer, in order to obtain the information you need for your assignment. This is a good way to break the assignment down into parts. We call these questions focus questions, and the different parts of the topic can be referred to as subtopics. 5. Brainstorm words which are associated with your focus questions. Write them down and then circle the ones that you think will be most useful. 6. Now you have your key terms, you are ready to search a number of resources for information. These include:  School library books: either topic search or subject search.  Periodicals in the school library: search for subject headings in Newscan index.  Periodical databases to which the school subscribes through eLibrary.  Articles available through eLibrary Science database.  Library Webs, available from the Library website, organises websites into subject areas.  Bremer’s Digital Library of useful websites.  Databases available through other library websites [e.g. Ipswich Library/ State Library];  Resources from other libraries/collections 6. When doing your research, try to use a variety of resources, such as books, magazines, databases and websites 7. Record your research findings. To ensure that your research is relevant to your topic, and to avoid plagiarism, use the retrieval sheets provided on the library website to record information you find in relation to your focus questions. You may well think of new focus questions, or alter the questions you have, as you go. This is probably a good sign, as the more you find out, the more questions may arise. 8. Acknowledge where you researched correctly. In this guide there is a section “References Helpful– Bibliography” and “hints for compiling a Bibliography” that provides direction on correct acknowledgment procedures.

If you go to Quick Links on the Library Catalogue Search, then Reading Lists, Then the topic you are studying, a list of resources useful for this should come up. Examples: Famous scientists; Ecotourism- year 10; Plagues. [Please let us know if a topic is not listed on the catalogue, and we will compile a list of resources for the future.]  Keyword search Try some of the keywords that you have developed from your focus questions. Enter them in the search window of Library Catalogue “Any words” and see what resources appear. If a title looks promising, click on the title to find out more about the resource. The expanded entry has a heading “Subjects”. The subject listings next to this heading are the proper search terms for library catalogue subject searches.

However, by taking time to plan your assignment you can ensure that you address all of the important aspects of the assignment and save time by researching only that information which is relevant to the assignment. The following planning sheet may help you to better structure and plan your assignments. Example of a Planning Sheet for an Analytical Exposition e.g. Essays where you have to argue that something is the case. 1. Your Introduction should introduce your argument or Thesis, generally - don’t go into detail here. Outline your argument - thesis. (What are you arguing should be the case?) 2. Your Developing Paragraphs make points to develop this argument and provide examples or quotes that explain and elaborate your points. 2 or 3 examples Topic Sentence - makes your point that relates to the thesis.  The point is developed further  with examples and often quotes to strengthen the point  Concluding Sentence - links back to topic sentence and the thesis of your exposition. Each paragraph should have this shape: References Topic Sentence Elaboration    Concluding sentence Plan all the points and examples into paragraphs before you begin to compose your first draft so you don’t miss out important information! 3. Your Conclusion should link back to your thesis. What have you proved is the case with your structured argument and examples? Sum up your strong points from each paragraph and make a final point that brings together the important material supporting your thesis. 2 or 3 points Topic sentence - linking back to thesis   summing up important points made in developing paragraphs.  Final Point - proving your case. X:\\Common\\ASSIGNMENT GUIDE\\Assignment Writing Guide v2010 v2.doc Page 14 of 21 RReeffeerreenncceess -- BBiibblliiooggrraapphhiieess Students undertaking research/assignment work must acknowledge their sources of information in the text of the assignment and in a bibliography at the end of the assignment. At Bremer the Harvard System is used for both acknowledging sources and compiling the bibliography. http://www.library.uq.edu.au/training/citation/harvard_6.pdf What? All sources of information that you use must be acknowledged. These include:  textbooks  journals  newspapers  encyclopaedias  cassettes or video recordings  statistical analyses  illustrations e.g. Maps, diagrams, photos  computer resources – e.g: CD, Internet Why? If you use another person’s ideas or writing and present them as your own, then you are guilty of plagiarism. Thus you could be marked down or failed. Using another person’s writing, correctly referencing it and discussing it in your own words can result in a higher assessment. When? You must acknowledge all direct quotations, ideas and paraphrased comments. However, facts and ideas that are common knowledge do not need to be acknowledged e.g. the date that Captain Cook sailed along the East Coast of Australia. How? 1. Books a.

Rogers and Phillips (1978) have made a strong plea for the outlawing of nuclear weapons. (Reference to arguments advanced in the whole work, so no page numbers used) 4. More than two decades ago Shaw (1955 : 272) wrote that Australian book sales per head were the highest in the world. (Paraphrasing from one page) 5. It is stated in Wild Life of Australia (1973 : 9) that ‘Australia is blessed with one of the largest varieties of bird life in any one country of the world.” (Quoting from an anonymous work) 6. The Australian Conservation Foundation (1970 : 2) claims that the ‘raging dry-season bushfire is easily the most dramatic feature of the Australian scene’. (Quoting words of a corporate author) 7. Referring to an argumentative relation, Baldwin (1973 : 18) remarks : ‘If you said “white” to him he would almost certainly say “black”.’ (Double quotation marks used within single ones - for a quote within a quotation) Author Date of Publication Page X:\\Common\\ASSIGNMENT GUIDE\\Assignment Writing Guide v2010 v2.doc Page 18 of 21 Longer quotations ometimes you may wish to include a longer quotation than the examples used above. According to “The Written Assignment” (1991: 14) it is common practise to regard quotations of more than 4 complete lines as long. If the quote is shorter than 4 lines, then it can be included in a sentence. Longer quotes need to be set out in indented block with no quotation marks word of caution is required regarding the use of direct quotations. Assignments are set so that you can show how well you can analyse, synthesise and perhaps evaluate information about a particular topic or issue. Huge “chunks” copied from texts simply illustrate that you are good at copying. As The Written Assignment (1991: 16) points out “Use the direct quotation to support a point. It is up to the writer to make the point, the direct quotation reinforces it.” The following examples from The Written Assignment (1991:15) illustrate how to do this. Short quote (fewer than 4 lines included in a sentence) Shaw (1955: 61) writes: ‘For twenty-five years after its foundation, the penal settlement of New South Wales had been shut in between the Blue Mountains and the sea’. Long quote (more than 4 lines - indented block no quotation marks) For twenty-five years after its foundation, the penal settlement of New South Wales had been shut in between the Blue Mountains and the sea. Every attempt to cross the mountain barrier had failed, stopped by its perpendicular gorges and rocky precipices. Even closer to Sydney exploration was difficult, as Governor Phillip himself had quickly found, although he had succeeded in reaching the Hawkesbury River, Pitt Water and Broken Bay. (Shaw, 1955 : 61) Illustrations and Diagrams Finally if an illustration you use is not original then you must acknowledge its source by writing the author’s surname, date and page in brackets at the bottom of the diagram. e.g. (SOURCE : Bell, 1983 : 97) S A X:\\Common\\ASSIGNMENT GUIDE\\Assignment Writing Guide v2010 v2.doc Page 19 of 21 RReemmiinnddeerrss WWhheenn CCoommppiilliinngg AA BBiibblliiooggrraapphhyy 1. Take careful note of the punctuation used in these examples. You must be consistent in your use of punctuation marks. 2. The year in brackets after the author’s name refers to the date of the latest edition. 3. When quoting the place of publication, in the case of a multi-national publishing firm, write the city closest to you (e.g. Sydney rather than New York or London.) PLAGIARISM You are required to identify all direct quotations, ideas, paraphrased comments; in short, any information not your own in the body of the assignment. If you do not acknowledge the exact source of the information then you are guilty of plagiarising. Plagiarism refers to the practice of using other writers’ ideas or comments and presenting them as your own. The most common forms of plagiarism are: 1. Copying word for word a writer’s comments without acknowledging by the appropriate referencing system. 2. Using a writer’s ideas and not acknowledging them. Even if you do not use any of the writer’s exact wording/phrasing 3. Paraphrasing a writer’s comments by selecting key words, substituting some of your own work without acknowledging it. NOTE: The simplest way to avoid plagiarism is to take notes from your sources in your own words. Write your final assignment with your notes only in front of you NOT the original references. Please note: All resources used for assignments should be listed in alphabetical order, according to the author’s name (or the title if no author is cited). While you have been shown how to cite resources within their various categories, when compiling bibliographies, do not separate books, websites, videos etc. under different headings.
