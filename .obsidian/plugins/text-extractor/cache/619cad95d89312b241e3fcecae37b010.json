Before WWII, the only ‘science’ • involved ‘relative dating’ Techniques. With the advancement of science, • ‘Absolute dating’ Began to appear Stratum a layer within a stratigraphic profile lawofsperposition The deeper it is the older it is G A Is Stratigraphy - studying the layers of soil found in an archaeological excavation.. It follows the principle of superposition. The idea that the deeper the layer is the older it is. By analysing a ‘Cross-section’ archaeologists can estimate the periods of activity. This is done by analysing the wall of an archaeological test pit or excavation site. Using the law of superposition, we can see that Stratum D is older than Stratum B, but younger than Stratum E. This would be interesting to an archaeologist, as these two look relatively the same, but clearly a lot has happened on the site between the two ‘events’ that would have brought those soil layers there. Your turn: Which layer is the oldest? Which layer is the youngest? Relative Dating: Stratigraphy C E C if A D G B E making assumptions companygt to other Which layer is the oldest? Which layer is the youngest? List the layers in order from oldest to earliest. A technique that was common in the mid 20th century. Seriation looks at changes in a style of artefact present at a site. A chronology is developed based on the assumption that one cultural style will slowly replace an earlier style over time. pottery is dated by sorting it • from basic to more intricate However, we can’t guess exact • years because they haven’t gone ahead and helped us archaeologists by stamping the date on it. Consider: Why wouldn’t this be reliable on its own as a dating technique? How could reliability be increased? Relative Dating: Seriation Increasing the reliability… Compare them to other sites! Use other dating techniques to support and find more absolute ages. Relative Dating: Fluorine A technique that analyses how much of the chemical fluorine has been absorbed by the bones from the surrounding soils in order to determine how long the specimen has been underground. The longer a bone has been in the ground, the more fluorine it has. The more fluorine… the older it is. However, his doesn’t give us calendar dates, so it is relative dating. no specific dates stratigraphy carries this use this to understand what archaeologists takefrom sites Let’s summarise relative dating techniques. Dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating is based on the fact that the timbers of a tree develop a new ring of growth each year. Rings are usually narrower when the weather has been poor and wider when it has been good. Tree rings and their widths form a pattern that is repeated on different trees of the same species. By comparing the pattern of rings found on an undated piece of timber with a pattern that has already been a attached and dated, scientists can work out the age of a particular piece of timber in a specific region. Wood is an artefact found in many archaeological sites. By comparing the rings of the wood to a master sequence, we can date sites fairly accurately. Absolute Dating: Dendrochronology Only works with substances containing organic materials, can only date materials a few hundred years old to approximately 40,000 years old. What materials can be dated? Any organic material. Charcoal, wood, twigs, seeds, bones, shells, leather, peat, lake mud, soil, hair, pottery, pollen, wall paintings, corals, blood residues, fabrics, paper or parchment,resins and water… and many more! Absolute Dating: Radiocarbon Key to this procedure involves the principle of radioactive decay. Carbon (abbreviated as C) is a chemical element that occurs in several different forms called isotopes, with slightly different atomic weights.. All living things can absorb, one type is Radiocarbon-14. After an organism dies and no longer absorbs carbon (through photosynthesis or eating other plants and animals) Carbon-14 gives out radiation and undergoes radioactive decay. Absolute Dating: Accelerator Mass Spetrometry (AMS) Dating The new and improved radiocarbon dating technique. The problem with radiocarbon dating is that it requires a sample • of a known weight that is carefully cleaned and then burned to create pure gas of carbon dioxide. Radioactive carbon isotopes in that gas are then counted using a • Geiger counter - the ticky things that measure radioactivity in nuclear fallout zones - Radiocarbon dating requires several grams of organic material • so that there can be enough emissions from the gas to measure. Thus, this severely limits what can be measured. • AMS dating involves very large instruments, that use • magnets and sensitive counters to separate and count individual carbon atoms by measuring their weight - a much more accurate process. The benefit? • Much smaller samples can be measured using AMS dating - less than 0.01grams of a sample is needed. A single nutshell or a cereal grain found at a site can be dated. This allows for sites to be dated that previously couldn’t be! • The important thing to recognise about • these two dating techniques is that they measure the same thing. However, they do so differently.. AMS is an EXTREMELY expensive • process and archaeology of sites often requires money, so scientists and archaeologists are usually restricted by what they can afford to do. Why bother with radiocarbon then? Absolute dating: Thermoluminescence The preferred method when an artefact age is older than 500,000 years. It can also be used to date burned flint (stone tools) and other burned materials at archaeological sites. What materials can be dated? Minerals dated for archaeology are quartz,feldspar and flint. Ceramics, burned flint bricks, hearts, slag and heating stones are all candidates. time willing dendroactivity","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
