In all, it completed 22 orbits of Saturn, sending extraordinary images and information back to Earth. In an earlier mission, the Voyager 1 spacecraft passed Pluto in 1990, and in 2004 it left our solar system. On board Voyager 1 was a time capsule carrying information about Earth and our achievements for, should they exist, any intelligent alien life forms it may reach. None of this would have been possible without mathematics. Mathematics and physics are essential to the launch and success of all space missions. It has been argued that should there ever be communication between Earthlings and intelligent extra-terrestrials, communication will be through mathematics. This is because mathematics is universal. It is universally true that Pythagoras’ theorem, a2 + b2 = c2, holds in every country on Earth and, by extension, in any galaxy in the universe. The concept of numbers in counting and the introduction of symbols for numbers marked the beginning of a major intellectual development in the minds of humans. Over the course of history, different categories of numbers have been defined that collectively form the real number system that we use today. 1.1.2 Syllabus links Lesson Lesson title Syllabus links 1.2 The real number system and surds ● Understand the concept of a surd as an irrational number represented using a square root or a radical sign. 1.3 Simplifying surds ● Simplify square roots of natural numbers which contain perfect square factors, e.g. √ 45 = √ 9 × 5 = √9√ 5 = 3√ 5. 1.4 Operations with surds and rationalising the ● Rationalise the denominator of fractional expressions involving square roots, e.g. √ 7 √ 3 = √ 7 √3 × √3 √3 = √ 7 × √3 √ 3 × √3 = √ 21 3 . ● Use the four operations to simplify surds, e.g. √5 − 2√ 5 + 4√ 5 = 3√ 5 and 2√3 × 5√11 = 10√ 33.

The table below shows the classification of numbers in our real number system. N = {1, 2, 3, 4, …} The set of natural numbers, that is the positive whole numbers or counting numbers Z = {… − 2, −1, 0, 1, 2 …} The set of integers, that is all positive and negative whole numbers and the number zero Q = {… −9 8 , 0.75, 0.3, 5, …} The set of rational numbers: all numbers that can be expressed in the form a b , b ≠ 0 and a, b ∈ Z, that is all fractions, integers and finite and recurring decimals. I = {… − √3, … , 𝜋, … √ 2, …} The set of irrational numbers: all real numbers that are not rational. Some irrational numbers, such as 𝜋 and e, are called transcendental numbers. R = Q ∪ I The set of real numbers, that is the union of the set of rational numbers and the set of irrational numbers The relationship between the sets, N ⊂ Z ⊂ Q ⊂ R, can be illustrated as shown. N Z Q R I N = natural numbers integersZ = rational numbersQ = irrational numbersI = = real numbersR The sets of the real number system can also be viewed as the following hierarchy. Real numbers R Non-integer rationals (terminating and recurring decimals) Integers Z Natural numbers N Irrational numbers I (surds, non-terminating and non-recurring decimals, π, e) Rational numbers Q CHAPTER 1 Surds 5 1.2.2 Irrational numbers A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers in the form a b , where b ≠ 0. All irrational numbers have a decimal representation that is non-terminating and non-recurring. This means the decimals do not terminate and do not repeat in any particular pattern or order. For example: √ 5 = 2.236 067 997 5 … 𝜋 = 3.141 592 653 5 … e = 2.718 281 828 4 … Rational or irrational Rational and irrational numbers combine to form the set of real numbers. We can find all of these numbers somewhere on the real number line as shown below. –– –m R–8 0 8 m–4–5 – 4 5 m e π m– ––0.8 . –4 ––.m–6 ––√ To classify a number as either rational or irrational, use the following steps: 1. Determine whether it can be expressed as a whole number, a fraction, or a terminating or recurring decimal. 2. If the answer is yes, the number is rational. If no, the number is irrational. WORKED EXAMPLE 1 Classifying numbers as rational or irrational Classify the following numbers as rational or irrational. 1 5 a. √25b. √13c. 3𝜋d. 0.54e. 3√ 64f. 3√32g. 3 √ 1 27 h.

Use your calculator to calculate the value of 3𝜋. d. 3𝜋 = 9.424 777 960 76 … 2. The answer is a non-terminating and non-recurring decimal; classify 3𝜋. 3𝜋 is irrational. e. 0.54 is a terminating decimal; classify it accordingly. e. 0.54 is rational. 6 Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Mathematical Methods Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition f. 1.

The result is a number in a rational form. 3 √ 1 27 is rational. 1.2.3 Surds A surd is an irrational number that is represented by a root sign or a radical sign, for example √ , 3√ , 4√ . Examples of surds include √7, √ 5, 3√ 11, 4√15. In general, a surd can be written in the form n√ x where x is a rational number and n is an integer such that n ≥ 0, and x > 0, when n is even. The numbers √ 9, √ 16, 3√125, and 4√ 81 are not surds as they can be simplified to rational numbers; that is, √ 9 = 3, √16 = 4, 3√125 = 5, 4√ 81 = 3, 3√–8 = –2. WORKED EXAMPLE 2 Identifying surds Determine which of the following numbers are surds. √ 16a. √ 13b. √ 1 16 c. 3√17d. 4√63e. 3√ −1728f. THINK WRITE a. 1. Evaluate √16. a. √ 16 = 4 2.

The answer is irrational (since it is a non-recurring and non-terminating decimal), so state your √ 13 is a surd. c. 1. Evaluate √ 1 16 . c. √ 1 16 = 1 4 2. The answer is rational (a fraction); state your conclusion. √ 1 16 is not a surd. CHAPTER 1 Surds 7 d. 1. Evaluate 3√ 17. d. 3√17 = 2.571 281 590 65 … 2.

The answer is rational; state your conclusion.An irrational number written in surd form gives an exact value of the number, whereas the same number written in decimal form gives an approximate value. For example: √ 2 is an exact number, but√ 2 ≈ 1.4142 to 4 decimal places. 3√ −1728 is not a surd. So b, d and e are surds.

Source: Mathematical Methods Senior Syllabus 2024 © State of Queensland (QCAA) 2024; licensed under CC BY 4.0. 1.3.1 Multiplying and simplifying surds Multiplication of surds To multiply surds, multiply the expressions under the radical sign. For example: √8 × √3 = √ 8 × 3 = √ 24 If there are coefficients in front of the surds that are being multiplied, multiply the coefficients and then multiply the expressions under the radical signs. For example: 2√3 × 5√7 = (2 × 5) √ 3 × 7 = 10√ 21 10 Jacaranda Maths Quest 11 Mathematical Methods Units 1 & 2 for Queensland Second Edition Multiplication of surds In order to multiply two or more surds, use the following: √ a × √ b = √ a × b m √a × n √b = mn √a × b where a and b are positive real numbers. Simplification of surds Surds are said to be in simplest form when the number under the square root sign contains no perfect square factors. If the radical sign is a cube root, then the simplest form has no perfect cube factors under the cube root. Simplification of a surd uses the method of multiplying surds in reverse. For example, to express √128 in its simplest form, find perfect square factors of 128. √128 = √ 64 × 2 = √64 × √2 = 8 × √ 2 ∴ √128 = 8√ 2 If possible, try to factorise the number under the radical sign so that the largest possible perfect square is used.

Add like terms to obtain the simplified answer. = 5ab√a + 6ab√ a − 10a√ b = 11ab√a − 10a√ b 1.4.2 Squaring surds When working with surds, it is sometimes necessary to multiply surds by themselves; that is, square them. Consider the following examples: (√ 2)2 = √ 2 × √2 = √ 4 = 2 (√ 5)2 = √ 5 × √5 = √ 25 = 5 Observe that squaring a surd produces the number under the radical sign. This is not surprising, because squaring and taking the square root are inverse operations and, when applied together, leave the original unchanged. Squaring surds When a surd is squared, the result is the expression under the radical sign; that is: (√a)2 = a where a is a positive real number. WORKED EXAMPLE 7 Squaring surds Simplify each of the following. (√ 6)2 a. ( 4√ 5)2 b. THINK WRITE a. Use (√ a)2 = a, where a = 6. a. (√6)2 = 6 b. 1. Square 4 and apply (√a)2 = a to square √ 5. b.

Multiplication and division with surds √c × √d = √cd a√c × b√d = ab√cd √c √d = √ c d When dividing surds, it is best to simplify them (if possible) first. Once this has been done, the coefficients are divided next and then the surds are divided. m √a n√ b = m n √ a b WORKED EXAMPLE 8 Dividing surds Divide the following surds, expressing answers in the simplest form.

Cancel any common factors — in this case √xy. = 6 5x4y5 1.4.4 Rationalising denominators If the denominator of a fraction is a surd, it can be changed into a rational number through multiplication. In other words, it can be rationalised. As discussed earlier in this chapter, squaring a simple surd (that is, multiplying it by itself) results in a rational number. This fact can be used to rationalise denominators as follows. Rationalising the denominator √ a √ b = √ a √b × √b √b = √ ab b If both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction are multiplied by the surd contained in the denominator, the denominator becomes a rational number. The fraction takes on a different appearance but its numerical value is unchanged, because multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number is equivalent to multiplying by 1. WORKED EXAMPLE 9 Rationalising the denominator Express the following in their simplest form with a rational denominator.√ 6 √ 5 a. 2√ 12 3√ 54 b. √ 17 − 3√14 √7 c. THINK WRITE a. 1.

This has the same effect as multiplying the fraction by 1, √ 6 √ 6 = 1. Note: We need to multiply only by the surd part of the denominator (that is by √ 6 rather than by 9√ 6). = 4√ 3 9√ 6 × √ 6 √ 6 = 4√ 18 9 × 6 4.
