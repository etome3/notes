{"path":"Literature/Term 3/attachments/image-10.png","text":"Revenge is a concept that lies at the heart of William Shakespeareâ€™s Hamlet, as it does Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, which established many of the formulaic aspects of the genre. For Elizabethans, however, revenge was God's preserve, with avengers likely to face dire punishment during life and after. So, although revenge tragedy was a fashionable genre, Shakespeare, in response to new attitudes circulating about revenge that he draws on to shape representations of characters, provides readers with a critique of the notion of revenge in this play. Indeed, Kieran Ryan, Professor of English, Oxford, argues that the play interrogates the genre and rejects antiquated notions of filial revenge. Through deft uxtaposition of the values of the protagonist, Hamlet, with those of his far less ethically attractive foils, Laertes, Fortinbras, and the Classical figure Pyrrhus, Shakespeare provides different perspectives on revenge to critique its place in a civilised society.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"eng"}
