Exposure controls/personal protection A time weighted average (TWA) concentration for an 8 hour day, and 5 day week has not been established by Safe Work Australia for this product. There is a blanket limit of 10 mg/m³ for dusts when limits have not otherwise been established. Other Exposure Information In industrial situations maintain the concentrations values below the TWA. This may be achieved by process modification, use of local exhaust ventilation, capturing substances at the source, or other methods. Appropriate engineering controls Where ventilation is not adequate, respiratory protection may be required. Avoid breathing vapours or mists. Select and use respirators in accordance with AS 1716 - Respiratory Protective Devices and be selected in accordance with AS 1715 - Selection, Use and Maintenance of Respiratory Protective Devices. When mists or vapours exceed the exposure standards then the use of the following is recommended: Approved respirator with organic vapour and dust/mist filters. Filter capacity and respirator type depends on exposure levels. Respiratory Protection The use of a face shield, chemical goggles or safety glasses with side shield protection as appropriate. Must comply with Australian Standards AS 1337 and be selected and used in accordance with AS 1336. Eye Protection Hand protection should comply with AS 2161, Occupational protective gloves - Selection, use and maintenance. Hand Protection Final choice of personal protective equipment will depend on individual circumstances and/or according to risk assessments undertaken. Personal Protective Equipment Clean clothing or protective clothing should be worn, preferably with an apron. Clothing for protection against chemicals should comply with AS 3765 Clothing for Protection Against Hazardous Chemicals. Body Protection Always wash hands before smoking, eating or using the toilet.
