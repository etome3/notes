Will it be in thunder, lightning, or rain? SECOND WITCH When the hurly-burly’s done, When the battle’s lost and won. SECOND WITCH We’ll meet when the noise of the battle is over, when one side has won and the other side has lost. 5 THIRD WITCH That will be ere the set of sun.

Act 1, Scene 2 Alarum within. Enter KING DUNCAN, MALCOLM,DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with attendants, meeting a bleeding CAPTAIN Sounds of a trumpet and soldiers fighting offstage. KING DUNCAN enters with his sonsMALCOLM and DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and a number of attendants. They meet a wounded and bloody CAPTAIN. DUNCAN What bloody man is that? He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state. DUNCAN Who is this bloody man? Judging from his appearance, I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt. 5 MALCOLM This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought 'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend! Say to the king the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it. MALCOLM This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured. Hail, brave friend! Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it. CAPTAIN Doubtful it stood, As two spent swimmers that do cling together CAPTAIN For a while you couldn’t tell who would win.

The merciless Macdonwald— Worthy to be a rebel, for to that The multiplying villanies of nature Do swarm upon him—from the Western Isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied, And fortune, on his damnèd quarrel smiling, Showed like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak, For brave Macbeth—well he deserves that name— Disdaining fortune, with his brandished steel, Which smoked with bloody execution, Like valor’s minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave; Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, Till he unseamed him from the nave to th' chops, And fixed his head upon our battlements. clinging to each other and struggling in the water, unable to move. The villainous rebel Macdonwald was supported by foot soldiers and horsemen from Ireland and the Hebrides, and Lady Luck was with him, smiling cruelly at his enemies as if she were his whore. But Luck and Macdonwald together weren’t strong enough. Brave Macbeth, laughing at Luck, chopped his way through to Macdonwald, who didn’t even have time to say good-bye or shake hands before Macbeth split him open from his navel to his jawbone and stuck his head on our castle walls. DUNCAN O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman! DUNCAN My brave relative! What a worthy man! Act 1, Scene 2, Page 2 25 30 CAPTAIN As whence the sun 'gins his reflection Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break, So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valor armed, Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbished arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault. CAPTAIN But in the same way that violent storms always come just as spring appears, our success against Macdonwald created new problems for us. Listen to this, King: as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover, the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons. DUNCAN Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? DUNCAN Didn’t this frighten our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? 35 40 CAPTAIN Yes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion. If I say sooth, I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks, So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe. Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, Or memorize another Golgotha, I cannot tell— But I am faint, my gashes cry for help. CAPTAIN The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles, or rabbits frighten a lion. To tell you the truth, they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition. Maybe they wanted to take a bath in their enemies' blood, or make that battlefield as infamous as Golgotha, where Christ was crucified, I don’t know. But I feel weak. My wounds must be tended to. DUNCAN So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honor both. Go get him surgeons. DUNCAN Your words, like your wounds, bring you honor. Take him to the surgeons.

DUNCAN Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane? DUNCAN Where have you come from, worthy thane? 50 55 ROSS From Fife, great king, Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold. Norway himself, with terrible numbers, Assisted by that most disloyal traitor, The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict, Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapped in proof, Confronted him with self-comparisons, Point against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm, Curbing his lavish spirit; and to conclude, The victory fell on us. ROSS Great king, I’ve come from Fife, where the Norwegian flag flies, mocking our country and frightening our people. Leading an enormous army and assisted by that disloyal traitor, the thane of Cawdor, the king of Norway began a bloody battle. But outfitted in his battle-weathered armor, Macbeth met the Norwegian attacks shot for shot, as if he were the goddess of war’s husband. Finally he broke the enemy’s spirit, and we were victorious. DUNCAN Great happiness! DUNCAN Great happiness! 60 ROSS That now Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition. Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use. ROSS So now Sweno, the Norwegian king, wants a treaty. We told him we wouldn’t even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme’s Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars. 65 DUNCAN No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death, And with his former title greet Macbeth. DUNCAN The thane of Cawdor will never again betray me. Go announce that he will be executed, and tell Macbeth that Cawdor’s titles will be given to him. ROSS I’ll see it done. ROSS I’ll get it done right away. DUNCAN What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won. DUNCAN The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won. Exeunt They all exit. Act 1, Scene 3 Thunder.

FIRST WITCH I already have control of all the other winds, along with the ports from which they blow and every direction on the sailor’s compass in which they can go. I’ll drain the life out of him. He won’t catch a wink of sleep, either at night or during the day. He will live as a cursed man. For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony.

Or are you aught That man may question? You seem to understand me, By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips. You should be women, And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so. BANQUO How far is it supposed to be to Forres? (he sees the WITCHES) What are these creatures? They’re so withered-looking and crazily dressed. They don’t look like they belong on this planet, but I see them standing here on Earth. (to theWITCHES) Are you alive? Can you answer questions? You seem to understand me, because each of you has put a gruesome finger to her skinny lips. You look like women, but your beards keep me from believing that you really are. Act 1, Scene 3, Page 3 MACBETH Speak, if you can: what are you? MACBETH Speak, if you can. What kind of creatures are you? FIRST WITCH All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Glamis!

THIRD WITCH All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter! THIRD WITCH All hail, Macbeth, the future king! 55 60 BANQUO Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair? (to the WITCHES) I' th' name of truth, Are ye fantastical, or that indeed Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope, That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not. If you can look into the seeds of time And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak, then, to me, who neither beg nor fear Your favors nor your hate. BANQUO My dear Macbeth, why do you look so startled and afraid of these nice things they’re saying?(to the WITCHES) Tell me honestly, are you illusions, or are you really what you seem to be? You’ve greeted my noble friend with honors and talk of a future so glorious that you’ve made him speechless. But you don’t say anything to me. If you can see the future and say how things will turn out, tell me. I don’t want your favors and I’m not afraid of your hatred. FIRST WITCH Hail! FIRST WITCH Hail! SECOND WITCH Hail! SECOND WITCH Hail! 65 THIRD WITCH Hail! THIRD WITCH Hail! FIRST WITCH Lesser than Macbeth and greater. FIRST WITCH You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater. SECOND WITCH Not so happy, yet much happier. SECOND WITCH You are not as happy as Macbeth, yet much happier. THIRD WITCH Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none. So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo! THIRD WITCH Your descendants will be kings, even though you will not be one. So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

FIRST WITCH Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! 75 MACBETH Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more. By Sinel’s death I know I am thane of Glamis. But how of Cawdor? The thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman, and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief, No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence, or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting. Speak, I charge you. MACBETH Wait! You only told me part of what I want to know. Stay and tell me more. I already know I am the thane of Glamis because I inherited the position when my father, Sinel, died. But how can you call me the thane of Cawdor? The thane of Cawdor is alive, and he’s a rich and powerful man. And for me to be the king is completely impossible, just as it’s impossible for me to be thane of Cawdor. Tell me where you learned these strange things, and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting? Speak, I command you. WITCHES vanish The WITCHESvanish. 80 BANQUO The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, And these are of them. Whither are they vanished? BANQUO The earth has bubbles, just like the water, and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth. Where did they disappear to? MACBETH Into the air, and what seemed corporal Melted, as breath into the wind. Would they had stayed. MACBETH Into thin air. Their bodies melted like breath in the wind. I wish they had stayed! 85 BANQUO Were such things here as we do speak about? Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner? BANQUO Were these things we’re talking about really here? Or are we both on drugs? MACBETH Your children shall be kings. MACBETH Your children will be kings. BANQUO You shall be king. BANQUO You will be the king. MACBETH And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so? MACBETH And thane of Cawdor too. Isn’t that what they said? BANQUO To the selfsame tune and words. Who’s here?

Act 1, Scene 3, Page 5 90 95 100 ROSS The king hath happily received, Macbeth, The news of thy success, and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight, His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that, In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day, He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks, Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, Strange images of death. As thick as tale Can post with post, and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense, ROSS The king was happy to hear of your success, Macbeth. Whenever he hears the story of your exploits in the fight against the rebels, he becomes so amazed it makes him speechless. He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway, and that you weren’t the least bit afraid of death, even as you killed everyone around you. Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -7- Original Text Modern Text And poured them down before him. country. ANGUS We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks, Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee. ANGUS The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him. Your real reward won’t come from us. 105 ROSS And, for an earnest of a greater honor, He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor: In which addition, hail, most worthy thane, For it is thine. ROSS And to give you a taste of what’s in store for you, he told me to call you the thane of Cawdor. So hail, thane of Cawdor! That title belongs to you now. BANQUO What, can the devil speak true? BANQUO (shocked) Can the devil tell the truth? 110 MACBETH The thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me In borrowed robes? MACBETH The thane of Cawdor is still alive. Why are you putting his clothes on me? 115 ANGUS Who was the thane lives yet, But under heavy judgment bears that life Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined With those of Norway, or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage, or that with both He labored in his country’s wrack, I know not; But treasons capital, confessed and proved, Have overthrown him. ANGUS The man who was the thane of Cawdor is still alive, but he’s been sentenced to death, and he deserves to die. I don’t know whether he fought on Norway’s side, or if he secretly aided the rebels, or if he fought with both of our enemies. But his treason, which has been proven, and to which he’s confessed, means he’s finished. Act 1, Scene 3, Page 6 120 MACBETH (aside) Glamis, and thane of Cawdor! The greatest is behind. (to ROSS and ANGUS)Thanks for your pains. (aside to BANQUO) Do you not hope your children shall be kings, When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me Promised no less to them? MACBETH (to himself) It’s just like they said—now I’m the thane of Glamis and the thane of Cawdor. And the best part of what they predicted is still to come. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Thank you for the news. (speaking so that only BANQUO can hear) Aren’t you beginning to hope your children will be kings? After all, the witches who said I was thane of Cawdor promised them nothing less. 125 BANQUO That, trusted home, Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, Besides the thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange. And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, The instruments of darkness tell us truths, Win us with honest trifles, to betray ’s In deepest consequence. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Cousins, a word, I pray you. BANQUO If you trust what they say, you might be on your way to becoming king, as well as thane of Cawdor. But this whole thing is strange. The agents of evil often tell us part of the truth in order to lead us to our destruction. They earn our trust by telling us the truth about little things, but then they betray us when it will damage us the most. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Gentlemen, I’d like to have a word with you, please. BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS move to one side ROSS, ANGUS, and BANQUO move to one side. 130 MACBETH (aside) Two truths are told, MACBETH (to himself) So far the witches have told me two No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -8- Original Text Modern Text 135 140 As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial theme. (to ROSS and ANGUS) I thank you, gentlemen. (aside) This supernatural soliciting Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill, Why hath it given me earnest of success, Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor. If good, why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs, Against the use of nature? Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings. things that came true, so it seems like this will culminate in my becoming king. (to ROSS andANGUS) Thank you, gentlemen. (to himself)This supernatural temptation doesn’t seem like it can be a bad thing, but it can’t be good either. If it’s a bad thing, why was I promised a promotion that turned out to be true? Now I’m the thane of Cawdor, just like they said I would be. But if this is a good thing, why do I find myself thinking about murdering King Duncan, a thought so horrifying that it makes my hair stand on end and my heart pound inside my chest? The dangers that actually threaten me here and now frighten me less than the horrible things I’m imagining. Act 1, Scene 3, Page 7 145 My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical, Shakes so my single state of man That function is smothered in surmise, And nothing is but what is not. Even though it’s just a fantasy so far, the mere thought of committing murder shakes me up so much that I hardly know who I am anymore. My ability to act is stifled by my thoughts and speculations, and the only things that matter to me are things that don’t really exist. BANQUO Look how our partner’s rapt. BANQUO Look at Macbeth—he’s in a daze. MACBETH (aside) If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me Without my stir. MACBETH (to himself) If fate wants me to be king, perhaps fate will just make it happen and I won’t have to do anything. 150 BANQUO New honors come upon him, Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mold But with the aid of use. BANQUO (to ROSS and ANGUS) Macbeth is not used to his new titles. They’re like new clothes: they don’t fit until you break them in over time. MACBETH (aside) Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day. MACBETH (to himself) One way or another, what’s going to happen is going to happen. BANQUO Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure. BANQUO Good Macbeth, we’re ready when you are. 155 160 MACBETH Give me your favor. My dull brain was wrought With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains Are registered where every day I turn The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king. (aside to BANQUO) Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time, The interim having weighed it, let us speak Our free hearts each to other. MACBETH I beg your pardon; I was distracted. Kind gentlemen, I won’t forget the trouble you’ve taken for me whenever I think of this day. Let’s go to the king. (speaking so that only BANQUOcan hear) Think about what happened today, and when we’ve both had time to consider things, let’s talk. BANQUO Very gladly. BANQUO Absolutely. MACBETH Till then, enough. (to ROSS and ANGUS) Come, friends. MACBETH Until then, we’ve said enough. (to ROSS andANGUS) Let’s go, my No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -9- Original Text Modern Text friends.

DUNCAN Has the former thane of Cawdor been executed yet? Haven’t the people in charge of that come back? 10 MALCOLM My liege, They are not yet come back. But I have spoke With one that saw him die, who did report That very frankly he confessed his treasons, Implored your highness' pardon, and set forth A deep repentance. Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it. He died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ’twere a careless trifle. MALCOLM My king, they haven’t come back yet. But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die, and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons, begged your highness’s forgiveness, and repented deeply. He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died. He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage. DUNCAN There’s no art To find the mind’s construction in the face. He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust. DUNCAN There’s no way to read a man’s mind by looking at his face. I trusted Cawdor completely. Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUSenter. 15 20 (to MACBETH) O worthiest cousin, The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved, That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine! Only I have left to say, More is thy due than more than all can pay. (to MACBETH) My worthiest kinsman! Just this moment I was feeling guilty for not having thanked you enough. You have done so much for me so fast that it has been impossible to reward you properly. If you deserved less, then perhaps my payment would have matched your deeds! All I can say is that I owe you more than I can ever repay. Act 1, Scene 4, Page 2 25 MACBETH The service and the loyalty I owe In doing it pays itself. Your highness' part Is to receive our duties, and our duties Are to your throne and state children and servants, Which do but what they should, by doing everything Safe toward your love and honor. MACBETH The opportunity to serve you is its own reward. Your only duty, your highness, is to accept what we owe you. Our duty to you and your state is like the duty of children to their father or servants to their master. By doing everything we can to protect you, we’re only doing what we should. 30 DUNCAN Welcome hither. I have begun to plant thee, and will labor To make thee full of growing. (to BANQUO) Noble Banquo, That hast no less deserved, nor must be known DUNCAN You are welcome here. By making you thane of Cawdor, I have planted the seeds of a great career for you, and I will make sure they grow. (toBANQUO) Noble Banquo, you deserve no less than Macbeth, and everyone should know No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -10- Original Text Modern Text No less to have done so, let me infold thee And hold thee to my heart. it. Let me bring you close to me and give you the benefit of my love and good will. BANQUO There, if I grow, The harvest is your own. BANQUO Then if I accomplish anything great, it will be a credit to you. 35 40 DUNCAN My plenteous joys, Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes, And you whose places are the nearest, know We will establish our estate upon Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter The prince of Cumberland; which honor must Not unaccompanied invest him only, But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine On all deservers. (to MACBETH) From hence to Inverness, And bind us further to you. DUNCAN My joy is so overwhelming it brings tears to my eyes. My sons, relatives, lords, and all those closest to me, I want you to witness that I will bestow my kingdom on my eldest son, Malcolm. Today I name him the prince of Cumberland. But Malcolm isn’t going to be alone in receiving honors—titles of nobility will shine like stars on all of you who deserve them. (to MACBETH) And now, let’s go to your castle at Inverness, where I will become even more obliged to you because of your hospitality. 45 MACBETH The rest is labor which is not used for you: I’ll be myself the harbinger and make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach. So humbly take my leave. MACBETH I’m not happy unless I can be working for you. I will go ahead and bring my wife the good news that you are coming. With that, I’ll be off. DUNCAN My worthy Cawdor! DUNCAN My worthy Cawdor! Act 1, Scene 4, Page 3 50 55 MACBETH (aside) The prince of Cumberland! That is a step On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap, For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires. The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see. MACBETH (to himself) Malcolm is now the prince of Cumberland! To become king myself, I’m either going to have to step over him or give up, because he’s in my way. Stars, hide your light so no one can see the terrible desires within me. I won’t let my eye look at what my hand is doing, but in the end I’m still going to do that thing I’d be horrified to see. Exit MACBETH exits. 60 DUNCAN True, worthy Banquo. He is full so valiant, And in his commendations I am fed; It is a banquet to me.—Let’s after him, Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome: It is a peerless kinsman. DUNCAN (to BANQUO, in the middle of a conversation we haven’t heard) You’re right, Banquo. Macbeth is every bit as valiant as you say, and I am satisfied with these praises of him. Let’s follow after him, now that he has gone ahead to prepare our welcome. He is a man without equal. Flourish. Exeunt Trumpet fanfare. They exit.

When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor,' by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time with 'Hail, king that shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou might’st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.” supernatural knowledge. When I tried desperately to question them further, they vanished into thin air. While I stood spellbound, messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor, which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’the future king!' I thought I should tell you this news, my dearest partner in greatness, so that you could rejoice along with me about the greatness that is promised to us. Keep it secret, and farewell.” 10 15 Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature; It is too full o' th' milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great, Art not without ambition, but without The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly, That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ld’st have, great Glamis, That which cries, “Thus thou must do,” if thou have it, And that which rather thou dost fear to do, Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither, That I may pour my spirits in thine ear And chastise with the valor of my tongue All that impedes thee from the golden round, Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem To have thee crowned withal. (she looks up from the letter) You are thane of Glamis and Cawdor, and you’re going to be king, just like you were promised. But I worry about whether or not you have what it takes to seize the crown. You are too full of the milk of human kindness to strike aggressively at your first opportunity. You want to be powerful, and you don’t lack ambition, but you don’t have the mean streak that these things call for. The things you want to do, you want to do like a good man. You don’t want to cheat, yet you want what doesn’t belong to you. There’s something you want, but you’re afraid to do what you need to do to get it. You want it to be done for you. Hurry home so I can persuade you and talk you out of whatever’s keeping you from going after the crown. After all, fate and witchcraft both seem to want you to be king.

SERVANT The king is coming here tonight. 20 LADY MACBETH Thou 'rt mad to say it. Is not thy master with him, who, were ’t so, Would have informed for preparation? LADY MACBETH You must be crazy to say that! Isn’t Macbeth with the king, and wouldn’t Macbeth have told me in advance so I could prepare, if the king were really coming? 25 SERVANT So please you, it is true: our thane is coming. One of my fellows had the speed of him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message. SERVANT I’m sorry, but it’s the truth. Macbeth is coming. He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message. LADY MACBETH Give him tending. He brings great news. LADY MACBETH Take good care of him. He brings great news. Exit SERVANT The SERVANT exits.

Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty. Make thick my blood. Stop up the access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between The effect and it! Come to my woman’s breasts, And take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature’s mischief. Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry “Hold, hold!” my fortress, where he will die. Come, you spirits that asist murderous thoughts, make me less like a woman and more like a man, and fill me from head to toe with deadly cruelty! Thicken my blood and clog up my veins so I won’t feel remorse, so that no human compassion can stop my evil plan or prevent me from accomplishing it! Come to my female breast and turn my mother’s milk into poisonous acid, you murdering demons, wherever you hide, invisible and waiting to do evil! Come, thick night, and cover the world in the darkest smoke of hell, so that my sharp knife can’t see the wound it cuts open, and so heaven can’t peep through the darkness and cry, “No! Stop!” Act 1, Scene 5, Page 3 Enter MACBETH MACBETH enters. 45 Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor, Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter, Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present, and I feel now The future in the instant. Great thane of Glamis! Worthy thane of Cawdor! You’ll soon be greater than both those titles, once you become king! Your letter has transported me from the present moment, when who knows what will happen, and has made me feel like the future is already here. 50 MACBETH My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight. MACBETH My dearest love, Duncan is coming here tonight. LADY MACBETH And when goes hence? LADY MACBETH And when is he leaving? MACBETH Tomorrow, as he purposes. MACBETH He plans to leave tomorrow. 55 60 LADY MACBETH O, never Shall sun that morrow see! Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters. To beguile the time, Look like the time. Bear welcome in your eye, Your hand, your tongue. Look like th' innocent flower, But be the serpent under ’t. He that’s coming Must be provided for; and you shall put This night’s great business into my dispatch, Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom. LADY MACBETH That day will never come. Your face betrays strange feelings, my lord, and people will be able to read it like a book. In order to deceive them, you must appear the way they expect you to look. Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes, your hands, and your words. You should look like an innocent flower, but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower. The king is coming, and he’s got to be taken care of. Let me handle tonight’s preparations, because tonight will change every night and day for the rest of our lives. MACBETH We will speak further. MACBETH We will speak about this further. 65 LADY MACBETH Only look up clear. To alter favor ever is to fear. Leave all the rest to me.

Hautboys play.DUNCAN enters, together with MALCOLM,DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNO X, MACDUFF,ROSS, ANGUS, and their attendants. DUNCAN This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses. DUNCAN This castle is in a pleasant place. The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses. 5 1 BANQUO This guest of summer, The temple-haunting martlet, does approve, By his loved mansionry, that the heaven’s breath Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle. Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed, The air is delicate. BANQUO The fact that this summer bird, the house martin, builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are. There isn’t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven’t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed. I’ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest. Enter LADY MACBETH LADY MACBETH enters. DUNCAN See, see, our honored hostess! The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains, And thank us for your trouble. DUNCAN Look, here comes our honored hostess! Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient, but I still accept it as love. In doing so, I’m teaching you to thank me for the incovenience I’m causing you by being here, because it comes from my love to you. 1 2 LADY MACBETH All our service, In every point twice done and then done double, Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your majesty loads our house. For those of old, And the late dignities heaped up to them, We rest your hermits. LADY MACBETH Everything we’re doing for you, even if it were doubled and then doubled again, is nothing compared to the honors you have brought to our family. We gladly welcome you as our guests, with gratitude for both the honors you’ve given us before and the new honors you’ve just given us. Act 1, Scene 6, Page 2 25 DUNCAN Where’s the thane of Cawdor? We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor; but he rides well, And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess, We are your guest tonight. DUNCAN Where is Macbeth, the thane of Cawdor? We followed closely after him. I hoped to arrive here before him, but he rides swiftly. And his great love, which is as sharp as his spur, helped him beat us here. Fair and noble hostess, we are your guests tonight. LADY MACBETH Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt, To make their audit at your highness' pleasure, Still to return your own. LADY MACBETH We are your servants, your highness, and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal, for after all, we keep it in your trust and we’re glad to give you back what’s yours. DUNCAN DUNCAN No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -14- Original Text Modern Text 30 Give me your hand. Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him.

Act 1, Scene 7 Hautboys. Torches. Enter a sewer and divers servants with dishes and service over the stage. Then enter MACBETH Hautboys play. The stage is lit by torches. A butler enters, and various servants carry utensils and dishes of food across the stage. ThenMACBETH enters. 10 15 20 25 MACBETH If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well It were done quickly. If the assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch With his surcease success; that but this blow Might be the be-all and the end-all here, But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, We’d jump the life to come. But in these cases We still have judgment here, that we but teach Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return To plague th' inventor: this even-handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice To our own lips. He’s here in double trust: First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, Who should against his murderer shut the door, Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So clear in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against The deep damnation of his taking-off; And pity, like a naked newborn babe, Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubim, horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air, Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself And falls on th' other. MACBETH If this business would really be finished when I did the deed, then it would be best to get it over with quickly. If the assassination of the king could work like a net, sweeping up everything and preventing any consequences, then the murder would be the be-all and end-all of the whole affair, and I would gladly put my soul and the afterlife at risk to do it. But for crimes like these there are still punishments in this world. By committing violent crimes we only teach other people to commit violence, and the violence of our students will come back to plague us teachers. Justice, being equal to everyone, forces us to drink from the poisoned cup that we serve to others. The king trusts me in two ways. First of all, I am his kinsman and his subject, so I should always try to protect him. Second, I am his host, so I should be closing the door in his murderer’s face, not trying to murder him myself. Besides, Duncan has been such a humble leader, so free of corruption, that his virtuous legacy will speak for him when he dies, as if angels were playing trumpets against the injustice of his murder. Pity, like an innocent newborn baby, will ride the wind with winged angels on invisible horses through the air to spread news of the horrible deed to everyone everywhere. People will shed a flood of tears that will drown the wind like a horrible downpour of rain. I can’t spur myself to action. The only thing motivating me is ambition, which makes people rush ahead of themselves toward disaster. Act 1, Scene 7, Page 2 Enter LADY MACBETH LADY MACBETH enters. How now! What news? What news do you have? LADY MACBETH He has almost supped. Why have you left the chamber? LADY MACBETH He has almost finished dinner. Why did you leave the dining room? 30 MACBETH Hath he asked for me? MACBETH Has he asked for me? No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -15- Original Text Modern Text LADY MACBETH Know you not he has? LADY MACBETH Don’t you know he has? 35 MACBETH We will proceed no further in this business. He hath honored me of late, and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon. MACBETH We can’t go on with this plan. The king has just honored me, and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people. I want to enjoy these honors while the feeling is fresh and not throw them away so soon. 40 45 LADY MACBETH Was the hope drunk Wherein you dressed yourself? Hath it slept since? And wakes it now, to look so green and pale At what it did so freely? From this time Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life, And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would, ” Like the poor cat i' th' adage? LADY MACBETH Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before? Have you gone to sleep and woken up green and pale in fear of this idea? From now on this is what I’ll think of your love. Are you afraid to act the way you desire? Will you take the crown you want so badly, or will you live as a coward, always saying “I can’t” after you say “I want to”? You’re like the poor cat in the old story. MACBETH Prithee, peace: I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none. MACBETH Please, stop! I dare to do only what is proper for a man to do. He who dares to do more is not a man at all. 50 55 LADY MACBETH What beast was ’t, then, That made you break this enterprise to me? When you durst do it, then you were a man; And to be more than what you were, you would Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place Did then adhere, and yet you would make both. They have made themselves, and that their fitness now Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me. I would, while it was smiling in my face, Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums And dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you Have done to this. LADY MACBETH If you weren’t a man, then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this? When you dared to do it, that’s when you were a man. And if you go one step further by doing what you dared to do before, you’ll be that much more the man. The time and place weren’t right before, but you would have gone ahead with the murder anyhow. Now the time and place are just right, but they’re almost too good for you. I have suckled a baby, and I know how sweet it is to love the baby at my breast. But even as the baby was smiling up at me, I would have plucked my nipple out of its mouth and smashed its brains out against a wall if I had sworn to do that the same way you have sworn to do this. Act 1, Scene 7, Page 3 MACBETH If we should fail? MACBETH But if we fail— 60 65 LADY MACBETH We fail? But screw your courage to the sticking-place, And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep— Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey Soundly invite him—his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory, the warder of the brain, Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason LADY MACBETH We, fail? If you get your courage up, we can’t fail. When Duncan is asleep—the day’s hard journey has definitely made him tired—I’ll get his two servants so drunk that their memory will go up in smoke through the chimneys of their brains. When they lie asleep like pigs, so drunk they’ll be dead to the world, what won’t you and I be able to do to the unguarded Duncan? And whatever we No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -16- Original Text Modern Text 70 A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep Their drenchèd natures lie as in a death, What cannot you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan?

Will it not be received, When we have marked with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers, That they have done ’t? MACBETH May you only give birth to male children, because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine. Once we have covered the two servants with blood, and used their daggers to kill, won’t people believe that they were the culprits? Act 1, Scene 7, Page 4 LADY MACBETH Who dares receive it other, As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar Upon his death? LADY MACBETH Who could think it happened any other way? We’ll be grieving loudly when we hear that Duncan has died. 80 MACBETH I am settled, and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat. Away, and mock the time with fairest show. False face must hide what the false heart doth know. MACBETH Now I’m decided, and I will exert every muscle in my body to commit this crime. Go now, and pretend to be a friendly hostess. Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false, evil heart. Exeunt They exit.

FLEANCE The moon is down. I have not heard the clock. FLEANCE The moon has set. The clock hasn’t struck yet. BANQUO And she goes down at twelve. BANQUO The moon sets at twelve, right? FLEANCE I take ’t ’tis later, sir. FLEANCE I think it’s later than that, sir. BANQUO Hold, take my sword. There’s husbandry in heaven; Their candles are all out. Take thee that too. A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers, Restrain in me the cursèd thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose. BANQUO Here, take my sword. The heavens are being stingy with their light. Take this, too. I’m tired and feeling heavy, but I can’t sleep. Merciful powers, keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest!

No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -17- Original Text Modern Text 15 BANQUO What, sir, not yet at rest? The king’s a-bed. He hath been in unusual pleasure, and Sent forth great largess to your offices. This diamond he greets your wife withal, By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up In measureless content. BANQUO You’re not asleep yet, sir? The king’s in bed. He’s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants. This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality. (he hands MACBETH a diamond) MACBETH Being unprepared, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought. MACBETH Because we were unprepared for the king’s visit, we weren’t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to. Act 2, Scene 1, Page 2 20 BANQUO All’s well. I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: To you they have showed some truth. BANQUO Everything’s OK. I had a dream last night about the three witches. At least part of what they said about you was true. MACBETH I think not of them. Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time. MACBETH I don’t think about them now. But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it, if you’re willing. BANQUO At your kind’st leisure. BANQUO Whenever you like. 25 MACBETH If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis, It shall make honor for you. MACBETH If you stick with me, when the time comes, there will be something in it for you. BANQUO So I lose none In seeking to augment it, but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear, I shall be counselled. BANQUO I’ll do whatever you say, as long as I can do it with a clear conscience. MACBETH Good repose the while! MACBETH Rest easy in the meantime. 30 BANQUO Thanks, sir: the like to you!

I can still see you, and you look as No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -18- Original Text Modern Text 45 50 55 60 As this which now I draw. Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going, And such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses, Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still, And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before. There’s no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtained sleep. Witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate’s offerings, and withered murder, Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf, Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace, With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives. Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. real as this other dagger that I’m pulling out now. (he draws a dagger) You’re leading me toward the place I was going already, and I was planning to use a weapon just like you. My eyesight must either be the one sense that’s not working, or else it’s the only one that’s working right. I can still see you, and I see blood splotches on your blade and handle that weren’t there before. (to himself) There’s no dagger here. It’s the murder I’m about to do that’s making me think I see one. Now half the world is asleep and being deceived by evil nightmares. Witches are offering sacrifices to their goddess Hecate. Old man murder, having been roused by the howls of his wolf, walks silently to his destination, moving like Tarquin, as quiet as a ghost. (speaking to the ground) Hard ground, don’t listen to the direction of my steps. I don’t want you to echo back where I am and break the terrible stillness of this moment, a silence that is so appropriate for what I’m about to do. While I stay here talking, Duncan lives. The more I talk, the more my courage cools. Act 2, Scene 1, Page 3 A bell rings A bell rings. I go, and it is done. The bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell. I’m going now. The murder is as good as done. The bell is telling me to do it. Don’t listen to the bell, Duncan, because it summons you either to heaven or to hell. Exit MACBETH exits. Act 2, Scene 2 Enter LADY MACBETH LADY MACBETH enters. LADY MACBETH That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold. What hath quenched them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern’st good-night. He is about it. The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged their possets, That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die. LADY MACBETH The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold. The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up. Listen! Quiet! That was the owl that shrieked, with a scary “good night” like the bells they ring before they execute people. Macbeth must be killing the king right now. The doors to Duncan’s chamber are open, and the drunk servants make a mockery of their jobs by snoring instead of protecting the king. I put so many drugs in their drinks that you can’t tell if they’re alive or dead. MACBETH (within) Who’s there? What, ho! MACBETH (from offstage) Who’s there? What is it? 10 LADY MACBETH Alack, I am afraid they have awaked, And ’tis not done. Th' attempt and not the deed Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready; LADY MACBETH Oh no, I’m afraid the servants woke up, and the murder didn’t happen. For us to attempt murder and not succeed would ruin us. (She hears a No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -19- Original Text Modern Text He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done ’t. noise.) Listen to that! I put the servants' daggers where Macbeth would find them. He couldn’t have missed them. If Duncan hadn’t reminded me of my father when I saw him sleeping, I would have killed him myself. Enter MACBETH, with bloody daggers MACBETH enters carrying bloody daggers. My husband! My husband! MACBETH I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise? MACBETH I have done the deed. Did you hear a noise? 15 LADY MACBETH I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Did not you speak? LADY MACBETH I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Didn’t you say something? MACBETH When? MACBETH When? Act 2, Scene 2, Page 2 LADY MACBETH Now. LADY MACBETH Just now. MACBETH As I descended? MACBETH As I came down? LADY MACBETH Ay. LADY MACBETH Yes. MACBETH Hark! Who lies i' th' second chamber? MACBETH Listen! Who’s sleeping in the second chamber? LADY MACBETH Donalbain. LADY MACBETH Donalbain. 20 MACBETH (looking at his hands) This is a sorry sight. MACBETH (looking at his bloody hands) This is a sorry sight. LADY MACBETH A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight. LADY MACBETH That’s a stupid thing to say. 25 MACBETH There’s one did laugh in ’s sleep, and one cried. “Murder!” That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them. But they did say their prayers, and addressed them Again to sleep. MACBETH One of the servants laughed in his sleep, and one cried, “Murder!” and they woke each other up. I stood and listened to them, but then they said their prayers and went back to sleep. LADY MACBETH There are two lodged together. LADY MACBETH Malcolm and Donalbain are asleep in the same room. MACBETH One cried, “God bless us!” and “Amen” the other, As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands. List'ning their fear I could not say “Amen,” When they did say “God bless us!” MACBETH One servant cried, “God bless us!” and the other replied, “Amen,” as if they had seen my bloody hands. Listening to their frightened voices, I couldn’t reply “Amen” when they said “God bless us!” 30 LADY MACBETH Consider it not so deeply. LADY MACBETH Don’t think about it so much. MACBETH But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”? MACBETH But why couldn’t I say “Amen”? I desperately No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -20- Original Text Modern Text I had most need of blessing, and “Amen” Stuck in my throat. needed God’s blessing, but the word “Amen” stuck in my throat. LADY MACBETH These deeds must not be thought After these ways. So, it will make us mad. LADY MACBETH We can’t think that way about what we did. If we do, it’ll drive us crazy. Act 2, Scene 2, Page 3 35 40 MACBETH Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep”—the innocent sleep, Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care, The death of each day’s life, sore labor’s bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course, Chief nourisher in life’s feast. MACBETH I thought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more! Macbeth is murdering sleep.” Innocent sleep. Sleep that soothes away all our worries. Sleep that puts each day to rest. Sleep that relieves the weary laborer and heals hurt minds. Sleep, the main course in life’s feast, and the most nourishing. LADY MACBETH What do you mean? LADY MACBETH What are you talking about? MACBETH Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house. “Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more.” MACBETH The voice kept crying, “Sleep no more!” to everyone in the house. “Macbeth has murdered sleep, and therefore Macbeth will sleep no more.” 45 50 LADY MACBETH Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand. Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there. Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood. LADY MACBETH Who said that? Why, my worthy lord, you let yourself become weak when you think about things in this cowardly way. Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands. Why did you carry these daggers out of the room? They have to stay there. Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood. MACBETH I’ll go no more: I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on ’t again I dare not. MACBETH I can’t go back. I’m afraid even to think about what I’ve done. I can’t stand to look at it again. 55 LADY MACBETH Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures. 'Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt. LADY MACBETH Coward! Give me the daggers. Dead and sleeping people can’t hurt you any more than pictures can. Only children are afraid of scary pictures. If Duncan bleeds I’ll paint the servants' faces with his blood. We must make it seem like they’re guilty. Exit LADY MACBETH exits.

Retire we to our chamber. A little water clears us of this deed. How easy is it, then! Your constancy Hath left you unattended. I hear someone knocking at the south entry.

More knocking. Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers. Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts. Listen! There’s more knocking.

PORTER Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell-gate, he should have old turning the key. PORTER This is a lot of knocking!

Who’s there, i' th' name of Beelzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty. Come in time, have napkins enough about you, here you’ll sweat for ’t. Knock, knock, knock! (pretending he’s the gatekeeper in hell) Who’s there, in the devil’s name? Maybe it’s a farmer who killed himself because grain was cheap. (talking to the imaginary farmer) You’re here just in time! I hope you brought some handkerchiefs; you’re going to sweat a lot here. Knock within A sound of knocking from offstage. Knock, knock! Who’s there, in th' other devil’s name? Faith, here’s an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God’s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in, equivocator. Knock, knock! Who’s there, in the other devil’s name? Maybe it’s some slick, two-faced con man who lied under oath. But he found out that you can’t lie to God, and now he’s going to hell for perjury. Come on in, con man. Knock within A sound of knocking from offstage. 5 Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Faith, here’s an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor. Here you may roast your goose. Knock, knock, knock! Who’s there? Maybe it’s an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people’s clothes.

I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire. Knock, knock! Never a moment of peace! Who are you? Ah, this place is too cold to be hell. I won’t pretend to be the devil’s porter anymore. I was going to let someone from every profession into hell. Knock within A sound of knocking from offstage. Anon, anon!

MACDUFF Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late? MACDUFF Did you go to bed so late, my friend, that you’re having a hard time getting up now? 10 PORTER 'Faith sir, we were carousing till the second cock. And drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things. PORTER That’s right sir, we were drinking until 3 A.M., and drink, sir, makes a man do three things. MACDUFF What three things does drink especially provoke? MACDUFF What three things does drink make a man do? PORTER Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore, much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him. PORTER Drinking turns your nose red, it puts you to sleep, and it makes you urinate. Lust it turns on but also turns off. What I mean is, drinking stimulates desire but hinders performance. Therefore, too much drink is like a con artist when it comes to your sex drive. It sets you up for a fall. It gets you up but it keeps you from getting off. It persuades you and discourages you. It gives you an erection but doesn’t let you keep it, if you see what I’m saying. It makes you dream about erotic experiences, but then it leaves you asleep and needing to pee. MACDUFF I believe drink gave thee the lie last night. MACDUFF I believe drink did all of this to you last night. Act 2, Scene 3, Page 3 PORTER That it did, sir, i' th' very throat on me; but I requited him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him. PORTER It did, sir. It got me right in the throat. But I got even with drink. I was too strong for it. Although it weakened my legs and made me unsteady, I managed to vomit it out and laid it flat on the ground. 15 MACDUFF Is thy master stirring? MACDUFF Is your master awake?

Where we lay, Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say, Lamentings heard i' th' air, strange screams of death, And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatched to the woeful time. The obscure bird Clamored the livelong night. Some say the Earth Was feverous and did shake. LENNOX The night has been chaotic. The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping. People are saying they heard cries of grief in the air, strange screams of death, and terrible voices predicting catastrophes that will usher in a woeful new age. The owl made noise all night.

The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood Is stopped; the very source of it is stopped. MACBETH You are, but you don’t know it yet. The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped. MACDUFF Your royal father’s murdered. MACDUFF Your royal father is murdered. MALCOLM Oh, by whom? MALCOLM Who did it? 80 LENNOX Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done ’t. Their hands and faces were all badged with blood. So were their daggers, which unwiped we found Upon their pillows. They stared, and were distracted. No man’s life was to be trusted with them. LENNOX It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it. Their hands and faces were all covered with blood. So were their daggers, which we found on their pillows, unwiped. They stared at us in confusion. No one’s life should have been entrusted to them. 85 MACBETH Oh, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them. MACBETH And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them. Act 2, Scene 3, Page 7 MACDUFF Wherefore did you so? MACDUFF What did you do that for? 90 95 MACBETH Who can be wise, amazed, temp'rate, and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man. Th' expedition of my violent love Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan, His silver skin laced with his golden blood, And his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature For ruin’s wasteful entrance; there, the murderers, Steeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers Unmannerly breeched with gore. Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make ’s love known? MACBETH Is it possible to be wise, bewildered, calm, furious, loyal, and neutral all at once? Nobody can do that. The violent rage inspired by my love for Duncan caused me to act before I could think rationally and tell myself to pause. There was Duncan, his white skin all splattered with his precious blood. The gashes where the knives had cut him looked like wounds to nature itself. Then right next to him I saw the murderers, dripping with blood, their daggers rudely covered in gore. Who could have restrained himself, who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it? LADY MACBETH Help me hence, ho! LADY MACBETH Help me out of here, quickly! MACDUFF Look to the lady.

In the great hand of God I stand, and thence Against the undivulged pretense I fight Of treasonous malice. When we’re properly dressed for the cold, let’s meet and discuss this bloody crime to see if we can figure anything out. Right now we’re shaken up by fears and doubts.

Wherever we go, men will smile at us while hiding daggers. Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us. 125 MALCOLM This murderous shaft that’s shot Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse, And let us not be dainty of leave-taking, But shift away. There’s warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there’s no mercy left. MALCOLM We haven’t yet encountered that danger, and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely. With that in mind, let’s get on our horses. We’d better not worry about saying polite good-byes; we should just get away quickly. There’s good reason to escape when there’s no mercy to be found anymore.

But last night’s horrors make everything that came before seem like a joke. 10 ROSS Ha, good father, Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act, Threatens his bloody stage. By th' clock ’tis day, And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp. Is ’t night’s predominance or the day’s shame That darkness does the face of Earth entomb When living light should kiss it? ROSS Ah yes, old man. You can see the skies. They look like they’re upset about what mankind has been doing, and they’re threatening the Earth with storms. The clock says it’s daytime, but dark night is strangling the sun. Is it because night is so strong, or because day is so weak, that darkness covers the earth when it’s supposed to be light? OLD MAN 'Tis unnatural, Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last, A falcon, tow'ring in her pride of place, Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed. OLD MAN It’s unnatural, just like the murder that has been committed. Last Tuesday a falcon was circling high in the sky, and it was caught and killed by an ordinary owl that usually goes after mice. 15 ROSS And Duncan’s horses—a thing most strange and certain— Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would Make war with mankind. ROSS And something else strange happened. Duncan’s horses, which are beautiful and swift and the best of their breed, suddenly turned wild and broke out of their stalls. Refusing to be obedient as usual, they acted like they were at war with mankind. OLD MAN 'Tis said they eat each other.

BANQUO Now you have it all: you’re the king, the thane of Cawdor, and the thane of Glamis, just like the weird women promised you. And I suspect you cheated to win these titles. But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants, and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead.

Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be feared. 'Tis much he dares, And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety. There is none but he Whose being I do fear, and under him My genius is rebuked, as it is said Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me And bade them speak to him. Then, prophetlike, They hailed him father to a line of kings. Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown And put a barren scepter in my grip, Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand, No son of mine succeeding. If ’t be so, For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind; For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered; Put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them; and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man, To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings! Rather than so, come fate into the list, And champion me to th' utterance. Who’s there? To be the king is nothing if I’m not safe as the king. I’m very afraid of Banquo. There’s something noble about him that makes me fear him. He’s willing to take risks, and his mind never stops working. He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely. I’m not afraid of anyone but him. Around him, my guardian angel is frightened, just as Mark Antony’s angel supposedly feared Octavius Caesar. Banquo chided the witches when they first called me king, asking them to tell him his own future. Then, like prophets, they named him the father to a line of kings. They gave me a crown and a scepter that I can’t pass on. Someone outside my family will take these things away from me, since no son of mine will take my place as king. If this is true, then I’ve tortured my conscience and murdered the gracious Duncan for Banquo’s sons. I’ve ruined my own peace for their benefit. I’ve handed over my everlasting soul to the devil so that they could be kings. Banquo’s sons, kings! Instead of watching that happen, I will challenge fate to battle and fight to the death. Who’s there! Enter SERVANT and two MURDERERS The SERVANT comes back in with twoMURDERERS Act 3, Scene 1, Page 4 75 Now go to the door and stay there till we call. Now go to the door and stay there until I call for No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -31- Original Text Modern Text you. Exit SERVANT The SERVANT exits. Was it not yesterday we spoke together? Wasn’t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other? FIRST MURDERER It was, so please your highness. FIRST MURDERER It was yesterday, your highness. 80 85 MACBETH Well then, now Have you considered of my speeches? Know That it was he, in the times past, which held you So under fortune, which you thought had been Our innocent self. This I made good to you In our last conference, passed in probation with you, How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say, “Thus did Banquo.” MACBETH Well, did you think about what I said? You should know that it was Banquo who made your lives hell for so long, which you always thought was my fault. But I was innocent. I showed you the proof at our last meeting. I explained how you were deceived, how you were thwarted, the things that were used against you, who was working against you, and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say, “Banquo did it!” FIRST MURDERER You made it known to us. FIRST MURDERER You explained it all. 90 MACBETH I did so, and went further, which is now Our point of second meeting. Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go? Are you so gospeled To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave And beggared yours forever? MACBETH I did that and more, which brings me to the point of this second meeting. Are you so patient and forgiving that you’re going to let him off the hook? Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children, a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever? FIRST MURDERER We are men, my liege. FIRST MURDERER We are men, my lord. 95 100 105 110 MACBETH Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men, As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept All by the name of dogs. The valued file Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, The housekeeper, the hunter, every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive Particular addition, from the bill That writes them all alike. And so of men. Now, if you have a station in the file, Not i' th' worst rank of manhood, say ’t, And I will put that business in your bosoms, Whose execution takes your enemy off, Grapples you to the heart and love of us, Who wear our health but sickly in his life, Which in his death were perfect. MACBETH Yes, you’re part of the species called men. Just as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, mutts, shaggy lapdogs, swimming dogs, and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs. But if you list the different kinds of dogs according to their qualities, you can distinguish which breeds are fast or slow, which ones are clever, which ones are watchdogs, and which ones hunters. You can classify each dog according to the natural gifts that separate it from all other dogs. It’s the same with men. Now, if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn’t down at the very bottom, tell me. Because if that’s the case, I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me. As long as Banquo lives, I am sick. I’ll be healthy when he is dead. Act 3, Scene 1, Page 5 No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -32- Original Text Modern Text SECOND MURDERER I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world. SECOND MURDERER My lord, I’ve been so kicked around by the world, and I’m so angry, that I don’t even care what I do. 115 FIRST MURDERER And I another So weary with disasters, tugged with fortune, That I would set my life on any chance, To mend it or be rid on ’t. FIRST MURDERER I’m the same. I’m so sick of bad luck and trouble that I’d risk my life on any bet, as long as it would either fix my life or end it once and for all. MACBETH Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy. MACBETH You both know Banquo was your enemy. BOTH MURDERERS True, my lord. BOTH MURDERERS It’s true, my lord. 120 125 MACBETH So is he mine; and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near’st of life. And though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down. And thence it is, That I to your assistance do make love, Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons. MACBETH He’s my enemy too, and I hate him so much that every minute he’s alive it eats away at my heart. Since I’m king, I could simply use my power to get rid of him. But I can’t do that, because he and I have friends in common whom I need, so I have to be able to moan and cry over his death in public even though I’ll be the one who had him killed. That’s why I need your help right now. I have to hide my real plans from the public eye for many important reasons. Act 3, Scene 1, Page 6 130 SECOND MURDERER We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us. SECOND MURDERER We’ll do what you want us to, my lord. FIRST MURDERER Though our lives— FIRST MURDERER Though our lives— 135 140 MACBETH Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most I will advise you where to plant yourselves, Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' th' time, The moment on ’t; for ’t must be done tonight, And something from the palace; always thought That I require a clearness. And with him— To leave no rubs nor botches in the work— Fleance, his son, that keeps him company, Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart. I’ll come to you anon. MACBETH (interrupts him) I can see the determination in your eyes. Within the next hour I’ll tell you where to go and exactly when to strike. It must be done tonight, away from the palace. Always remember that I must be free from suspicion. For the plan to work perfectly, you must kill both Banquo and his son, Fleance, who keeps him company. Getting rid of Fleance is as important to me as knocking off Banquo. Each of you should make up your own mind about whether you’re going to do this. I’ll come to you soon. BOTH MURDERERS We are resolved, my lord. BOTH MURDERERS We have decided, my lord. We’re in. 145 MACBETH I’ll call upon you straight. Abide within. MACBETH I’ll call for you soon. Stay inside. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -33- Original Text Modern Text Exeunt MURDERERS The MURDERERS exit. It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul’s flight, If it find heaven, must find it out tonight. The deal is closed. Banquo, if your soul is going to make it to heaven, tonight’s the night. Exit He exits. Act 3, Scene 2 Enter LADY MACBETH and a SERVANT LADY MACBETH and a SERVANT enter. LADY MACBETH Is Banquo gone from court? LADY MACBETH Has Banquo left the court? SERVANT Ay, madam, but returns again tonight. SERVANT Yes, madam, but he’ll be back tonight. LADY MACBETH Say to the king I would attend his leisure For a few words. LADY MACBETH Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes. 5 SERVANT Madam, I will. SERVANT No problem, madam. Exit SERVANT The SERVANT exits. LADY MACBETH Naught’s had, all’s spent, Where our desire is got without content. 'Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. LADY MACBETH If you get what you want and you’re still not happy, you’ve spent everything and gained nothing. It’s better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety. Enter MACBETH MACBETH enters. 10 How now, my lord! Why do you keep alone, Of sorriest fancies your companions making, Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on? Things without all remedy Should be without regard. What’s done is done. What’s going on, my lord? Why are you keeping to yourself, with only your sad thoughts to keep you company? Those thoughts should have died when you killed the men you’re thinking about. If you can’t fix it, you shouldn’t give it a second thought. What’s done is done. 15 20 25 MACBETH We have scorched the snake, not killed it. She’ll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave. After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well. Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further. MACBETH We have slashed the snake but not killed it. It will heal and be as good as new, and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once again. But the universe can fall apart, and heaven and earth crumble, before I’ll eat my meals in fear and spend my nights tossing and turning with these nightmares I’ve been having. I’d rather be dead than endure this endless mental torture and harrowing sleep deprivation. We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace. Duncan lies in his grave, through with life’s troubles, and he’s sleeping well. We have already done the worst we can do to him with our treason. After that, nothing can hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or anything else. Act 3, Scene 2, Page 2 LADY MACBETH LADY MACBETH No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -34- Original Text Modern Text 30 Come on, gentle my lord, Sleek o'er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovial Among your guests tonight. Come on, relax, dear. Put on a happy face and look cheerful and agreeable for your guests tonight. 35 MACBETH So shall I, love, And so, I pray, be you. Let your remembrance Apply to Banquo; present him eminence, Both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that we Must lave our honors in these flattering streams, And make our faces vizards to our hearts, Disguising what they are. MACBETH That’s exactly what I’ll do, my love, and I hope you’ll do the same. Give Banquo your special attention. Talk to him and look at him in a way that will make him feel important. We’re in a dangerous situation, where we have to flatter him and hide our true feelings. LADY MACBETH You must leave this. LADY MACBETH You have to stop talking like this. MACBETH Oh, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Thou know’st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives. MACBETH Argh! I feel like my mind is full of scorpions, my dear wife. You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive. 40 LADY MACBETH But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne. LADY MACBETH But they can’t live forever. 45 MACBETH There’s comfort yet; they are assailable. Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown His cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate’s summons The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note. MACBETH That’s comforting. They can be killed, it’s true. So be cheerful. Before the bat flies through the castle, and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it’s nighttime, a dreadful deed will be done. LADY MACBETH What’s to be done? LADY MACBETH What are you going to do? Act 3, Scene 2, Page 3 50 55 MACBETH Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale. Light thickens, and the crow Makes wing to th' rooky wood. Good things of day begin to droop and drowse; Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvel’st at my words: but hold thee still. Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, prithee, go with me. MACBETH It’s better you don’t know about it until after it’s done, when you can applaud it. (to the night)Come, night, and blindfold the kindhearted day. Use your bloody and invisible hand to tear up Banquo’s lease on life, which keeps me in fear.(to himself) The sky’s getting dark, and the crow is returning home to the woods. The gentle creatures of the day are falling asleep, while night’s predators are waking up to look for their prey. (to LADY MACBETH) You seem surprised at my words, but don’t question me yet. Bad deeds force you to commit more bad deeds. So please, come with me. Exeunt They exit. Act 3, Scene 3 Enter three MURDERERS The two MURDERERS enter with a thirdMURDERER. FIRST MURDERER But who did bid thee join with us? FIRST MURDERER But who told you to come here and join us? No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -35- Original Text Modern Text THIRD MURDERER Macbeth. THIRD MURDERER Macbeth. 5 SECOND MURDERER He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just. SECOND MURDERER We can trust this guy. He was given exactly the same orders we were. 10 FIRST MURDERER Then stand with us. The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day. Now spurs the lated traveler apace To gain the timely inn, and near approaches The subject of our watch. FIRST MURDERER Then stay with us. There’s still a bit of daylight in the sky. Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns. Banquo is almost here. THIRD MURDERER Hark, I hear horses. THIRD MURDERER Listen! I hear horses. BANQUO (within) Give us a light there, ho! BANQUO (from offstage) Hey, give us some light here! SECOND MURDERER Then ’tis he: the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i' th' court. SECOND MURDERER That must be him. The rest of the king’s guests are already inside. FIRST MURDERER His horses go about. FIRST MURDERER You can hear his horses moving around as the servants take them to the stables. 15 THIRD MURDERER Almost a mile; but he does usually— So all men do—from hence to the palace gate Make it their walk. THIRD MURDERER It’s almost a mile to the palace gate, but Banquo, like everybody else, usually walks from here to the palace. Enter BANQUO and FLEANCE with a torch BANQUO and FLEANCE enter with a torch. Act 3, Scene 3, Page 2 SECOND MURDERER A light, a light! SECOND MURDERER Here comes a light! Here comes a light! THIRD MURDERER 'Tis he. THIRD MURDERER That’s him. FIRST MURDERER Stand to ’t. FIRST MURDERER Prepare yourselves. BANQUO It will be rain tonight. BANQUO It will rain tonight. FIRST MURDERER Let it come down. FIRST MURDERER Then let the rain come down. The MURDERERS attack BANQUO The MURDERERS attack BANQUO. 20 BANQUO O treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly! Thou may ’st revenge —O slave! BANQUO Oh, this is treachery! Get out of here, good Fleance, run, run, run! Someday you can get revenge.—Oh, you bastard! BANQUO dies. Exit FLEANCE BANQUO dies. FLEANCE escapes. THIRD MURDERER Who did strike out the light? THIRD MURDERER Who put out the light? FIRSTMURDERER Was ’t not the way? FIRST MURDERER Wasn’t that the best thing to do? No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -36- Original Text Modern Text THIRD MURDERER There’s but one down. The son is fled. THIRD MURDERER There’s only one body here. The son ran away. SECOND MURDERER We have lost best half of our affair. SECOND MURDERER We failed in half of our mission. FIRST MURDERER Well, let’s away and say how much is done. FIRST MURDERER Well, let’s get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish. Exeunt They exit. Act 3, Scene 4 Banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, LORDS, and attendants. The stage is set for a banquet. MACBETH enters with LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX,LORDS, and their attendants. MACBETH You know your own degrees; sit down. At first And last, the hearty welcome. MACBETH You know your own ranks, so you know where to sit. Sit down. From the highest to the lowest of you, I bid you a hearty welcome. The LORDS sit The LORDS sit down. LORDS Thanks to your majesty. LORDS Thanks to your majesty. 5 MACBETH Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time We will require her welcome. MACBETH I will walk around and mingle with all of you, playing the humble host. My wife will stay in her royal chair, but at the appropriate time I will have her welcome you all. LADY MACBETH Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends, For my heart speaks they are welcome. LADY MACBETH Say welcome to all of our friends for me, sir, for in my heart they are all welcome. Enter FIRST MURDERER at the door The FIRST MURDERER appears at the door. 10 MACBETH See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks. Both sides are even. Here I’ll sit i' th' midst. Be large in mirth. Anon we’ll drink a measure The table round. MACBETH And they respond to you with their hearts as well. The table is full on both sides. I will sit here in the middle. Be free and happy. Soon we will toast around the table. (aside to FIRST MURDERER) There’s blood upon thy face. (approaching the door and speaking to theMURDERER) There’s blood on your face. FIRST MURDERER 'Tis Banquo’s then. FIRST MURDERER Then it must be Banquo’s. 15 MACBETH 'Tis better thee without than he within. Is he dispatched? MACBETH I’d rather see his blood splattered on your face than flowing through his veins. Did you finish him off? Act 3, Scene 4, Page 2 FIRST MURDERER My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him. FIRST MURDERER My lord, his throat is cut. I did that to him. MACBETH Thou art the best o' th' cutthroats: Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance. MACBETH You are the best of the cutthroats. But whoever did the same to Fleance must also be good. If No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -37- Original Text Modern Text 20 If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil. you cut both their throats, then you are the absolute best. FIRST MURDERER Most royal sir, Fleance is ’scaped. FIRST MURDERER Most royal sir, Fleance has escaped. 25 MACBETH Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect, Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air. But now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in To saucy doubts and fears.—But Banquo’s safe? MACBETH Now I’m scared again. Otherwise I would have been perfect, as solid as a piece of marble, as firm as a rock, as free as the air itself. But now I’m all tangled up with doubts and fears. But Banquo’s been taken care of? FIRST MURDERER Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenchèd gashes on his head, The least a death to nature. FIRST MURDERER Yes, my good lord. He’s lying dead in a ditch, with twenty deep gashes in his head, any one of which would have been enough to kill him. 30 MACBETH Thanks for that. There the grown serpent lies. The worm that’s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed; No teeth for th' present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow We’ll hear ourselves again. MACBETH Thanks for that. The adult snake lies in the ditch. The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening, but for now he has no fangs. Get out of here. I’ll talk to you again tomorrow. Exit FIRST MURDERER The FIRST MURDERER exits. 35 LADY MACBETH My royal lord, You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold That is not often vouched, while ’tis a-making, 'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home; From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it. LADY MACBETH My royal lord, you’re not entertaining the guests. If you don’t make your guests know they’re welcome, they’ll feel like they’re paying for their meal. When you just want to eat, it’s better to do that at home. When you’re eating out with people, you need to have a little more ceremony. Otherwise dinner parties would be boring. Act 3, Scene 4, Page 3 40 MACBETH Sweet remembrancer! Now, good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both! MACBETH It’s nice of you to remind me. (raising a glass to toast his guests) Since good digestion requires a good appetite, and good health requires both of those, here’s to good appetites, good digestion, and good health! LENNOX May ’t please your highness sit. LENNOX Why don’t you have a seat, your highness? Enter the GHOST OF BANQUO, and sits inMACBETH’s place The GHOST OF BANQUO enters and sits inMACBETH’s place. 45 MACBETH Here had we now our country’s honor roofed, Were the graced person of our Banquo present, Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance. MACBETH We would have all the nobility of Scotland gathered under one roof, if only Banquo were here. I hope it turns out that he’s late out of rudeness, and not because something bad has happened to him. ROSS His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise. Please ’t your highness To grace us with your royal company? ROSS His absence means he’s broken his promise, sir. If it pleases you, your highness, why don’t you sit with us and grace us with your royal company? No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -38- Original Text Modern Text MACBETH The table’s full. MACBETH The table’s full. LENNOX Here is a place reserved, sir. LENNOX Here’s an empty seat, sir. 50 MACBETH Where? MACBETH Where? LENNOX Here, my good lord. What is ’t that moves your highness? LENNOX (pointing to where the GHOST sits) Here, my good lord. What’s wrong, your highness? MACBETH Which of you have done this? MACBETH (seeing the GHOST) Which one of you did this? LORDS What, my good lord? LORDS What, my good lord? MACBETH (to GHOST) Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake Thy gory locks at me. MACBETH (to the GHOST) You can’t say I did it. Don’t shake your bloody head at me. Act 3, Scene 4, Page 4 55 ROSS Gentlemen, rise. His highness is not well. ROSS Gentlemen, stand up. His highness is not well. 60 LADY MACBETH Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat. The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well. If much you note him, You shall offend him and extend his passion. Feed and regard him not. (aside to MACBETH) Are you a man? LADY MACBETH Sit down, worthy friends. My husband is often like this, and he has been since he was a child. Please stay seated. This is just a brief fit. In a moment he’ll be well again. If you pay too much attention to him you’ll make him angry, and that will make his convulsions go on longer. Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him. (speaking so that only MACBETH can hear) Are you a man? MACBETH Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appall the devil. MACBETH Yes, and a brave one, who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil. 65 70 LADY MACBETH O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear. This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan. Oh, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire, Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all’s done, You look but on a stool. LADY MACBETH Oh, that’s nonsense! This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid. This is like that floating dagger you said was leading you toward Duncan. These outbursts of yours don’t even look like real fear. They’re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother. Shame on you! Why are you making these faces? When the vision passes, you’ll see that you’re just looking at a stool. 75 MACBETH Prithee, see there! Behold! Look! Lo! How say you? Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too. If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our monuments Shall be the maws of kites. MACBETH Please, just look over there. Look! Look! See! (to the GHOST) What do you have to say? What do I care? If you can nod, then speak too. If the dead are going to return from their graves, then there’s nothing to stop the birds from eating the bodies. So there’s no point in our burying people. Exit GHOST The GHOST vanishes. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -39- Original Text Modern Text LADY MACBETH What, quite unmanned in folly? LADY MACBETH What, has your foolishness paralyzed you completely? Act 3, Scene 4, Page 5 MACBETH If I stand here, I saw him. MACBETH As sure as I’m standing here, I saw him. LADY MACBETH Fie, for shame! LADY MACBETH Nonsense! 80 85 MACBETH Blood hath been shed ere now, i' th' olden time, Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal; Ay, and since too, murders have been performed Too terrible for the ear. The time has been That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end. But now they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns And push us from our stools. This is more strange Than such a murder is. MACBETH In ancient times, before there were laws to make the land safe and peaceful, a lot of blood was spilled. Yes, and since then murders have been committed that are too awful to talk about. It used to be that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die, and that would be it. But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools. This haunting business is even stranger than murder. LADY MACBETH My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you. LADY MACBETH My worthy lord, your noble friends miss your company. 90 MACBETH I do forget. Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends. I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me. Come, love and health to all. Then I’ll sit down. Give me some wine. Fill full. MACBETH I forgot about them. (to the guests) Don’t be alarmed on my account, my most worthy friends. I have a strange disorder, which no longer shocks those who know me well. (raising his glass to toast the company) Come, let’s drink a toast: love and health to you all. Now I’ll sit down. Give me some wine. Fill up my cup. Enter the GHOST OF BANQUO The GHOST OF BANQUO reappears inMACBETH’s seat. 95 I drink to the general joy o' th' whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss; Would he were here! To all and him we thirst, And all to all. I drink to the happiness of everyone at the table, and to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss. I wish he were here! Let’s drink to everyone here, and to Banquo. Now, everybody, drink LORDS Our duties, and the pledge. LORDS Hear, hear. They drink They drink. Act 3, Scene 4, Page 6 100 MACBETH (seeing the GHOST) Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee. Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold. Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with! MACBETH (to the GHOST) Go! And get out of my sight! Stay in your grave. There’s no marrow in your bones, and your blood is cold. You’re staring at me with eyes that have no power to see. LADY MACBETH Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom. 'Tis no other; Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. LADY MACBETH Good friends, think of this as nothing more than a strange habit. It’s nothing else. Too bad it’s spoiling our pleasure tonight. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -40- Original Text Modern Text 105 110 MACBETH What man dare, I dare. Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The armed rhinoceros, or th' Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble. Or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword. If trembling I inhabit then, protest me The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mockery, hence! MACBETH I am as brave as any other man. Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear, an armor- plated rhinoceros, or a tiger from Iran. Take any shape other than the one you have now and I will never tremble in fear. Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place. If I tremble then, you can call me a little girl. Get out of here, you horrible ghost, you hallucination. Get out! Exit GHOST The GHOST vanishes. Why so, being gone, I am a man again. Pray you sit still. Why so, being gone, I am a man again. Pray you sit still. Look, now that it’s gone, I’m a man again. Please, remain seated. LADY MACBETH You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder. LADY MACBETH You have ruined our good cheer and disrupted the gathering by making a spectacle of yourself. 115 120 MACBETH Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer’s cloud, Without our special wonder? You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine is blanched with fear. MACBETH (to the guests) Can things like this happen so suddenly without making us all astonished? You make me feel like I don’t know myself, when I see you looking at these terrible things and keeping a straight face, while my face has gone white with fear. ROSS What sights, my lord? ROSS What things, my lord? Act 3, Scene 4, Page 7 LADY MACBETH I pray you, speak not. He grows worse and worse. Question enrages him. At once, good night. Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once. LADY MACBETH Please, don’t speak to him. He’s getting worse and worse. Talk makes him crazy. Everybody, please leave right now. Don’t bother exiting in the order of your rank, but just leave right away. 125 LENNOX Good night, and better health Attend his majesty! LENNOX Good night. I hope the king recovers soon! LADY MACBETH A kind good night to all! LADY MACBETH A kind good night to all!

Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak. Augurs and understood relations have By magot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret’st man of blood.—What is the night? MACBETH There’s an old saying: the dead will have their revenge. Gravestones have been known to move, and trees to speak, to bring guilty men to justice. The craftiest murderers have been exposed by the mystical signs made by crows and magpies. How late at night is it? LADY MACBETH Almost at odds with morning, which is which. LADY MACBETH It’s almost morning. You can’t tell whether it’s day or night.

MACBETH What do you think about the fact that Macduff refuses to come to me when I command him? LADY MACBETH Did you send to him, sir? LADY MACBETH Did you send for him, sir? 140 145 MACBETH I hear it by the way; but I will send. There’s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow— And betimes I will—to the weird sisters. More shall they speak, for now I am bent to know, By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good, All causes shall give way. I am in blood Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er. Strange things I have in head, that will to hand, Which must be acted ere they may be scanned. MACBETH I’ve heard about this indirectly, but I will send for him. In every one of the lords' households I have a servant paid to spy for me. Tomorrow, while it’s still early, I will go see the witches. They will tell me more, because I’m determined to know the worst about what’s going to happen. My own safety is the only important thing now. I have walked so far into this river of blood that even if I stopped now, it would be as hard to go back to being good as it is to keep killing people. I have some schemes in my head that I’m planning to put into action. I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them.

My strange and self-abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use. We are yet but young in deed. MACBETH Yes, let’s go to sleep. My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience.

FIRST WITCH Why, how now, Hecate! You look angerly. FIRST WITCH What’s wrong, Hecate? You look angry. 10 15 HECATE Have I not reason, beldams as you are? Saucy and overbold, how did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death, And I, the mistress of your charms, The close contriver of all harms, Was never called to bear my part, Or show the glory of our art? And, which is worse, all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you. But make amends now. Get you gone, And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i' th' morning. Thither he Will come to know his destiny. Your vessels and your spells provide, HECATE Don’t I have a reason to be angry, you disobedient hags? How dare you give Macbeth riddles and prophecies about his future without telling me? I am your boss and the source of your powers. I am the one who secretly decides what evil things happen, but you never called me to join in and show off my own powers. And what’s worse, you’ve done all this for a man who behaves like a spoiled brat, angry and hateful. Like all spoiled sons, he chases after what he wants and doesn’t care about you. But you can make it up to me. Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell. Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny. You bring your cauldrons, your spells, your charms, and everything else. I’m about to fly away. I’ll spend tonight working to make something horrible No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -42- Original Text Modern Text 20 25 Your charms and everything beside. I am for the air. This night I’ll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end. Great business must be wrought ere noon. Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap'rous drop profound. I’ll catch it ere it come to ground. And that distilled by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion. happen. I have a lot to do before noon. An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon. I’ll catch it before it falls to the ground. When I work it over with magic spells, the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions. Act 3, Scene 5, Page 2 30 He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear. And you all know, security Is mortals' chiefest enemy. He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate, he will mock death, and he will think he is above wisdom, grace, and fear. As you all know, overconfidence is man’s greatest enemy. Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,' &c Music plays offstage, and voices sing a song with the words “Come away, come away.” 35 Hark! I am called. My little spirit, see, Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me. Listen! I’m being called. Look, my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me. Exit HECATE exits.

Act 3, Scene 6 Enter LENNOX and another LORD LENNOX and another LORD enter. 10 15 20 LENNOX My former speeches have but hit your thoughts, Which can interpret farther. Only I say Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth. Marry, he was dead. And the right-valiant Banquo walked too late, Whom, you may say, if ’t please you, Fleance killed, For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late. Who cannot want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father? Damnèd fact! How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight In pious rage the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too, For ’twould have angered any heart alive To hear the men deny ’t. So that, I say, He has borne all things well. And I do think That had he Duncan’s sons under his key— As, an’t please heaven, he shall not—they should find What ’twere to kill a father. So should Fleance. But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he LENNOX What I’ve already said shows you we think alike, so you can draw your own conclusions. All I’m saying is that strange things have been going on. Macbeth pitied Duncan—after Duncan was dead. And Banquo went out walking too late at night. If you like, we can say that Fleance must have killed him, because Fleance fled the scene of the crime. Clearly, men should not go out walking too late! And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father? Such a heinous crime—how it saddened Macbeth! Wasn’t it loyal of him to kill those two servants right away, while they were still drunk and asleep? That was the right thing to do, wasn’t it? Yes, and it was the wise thing, too, because we all would have been outraged to hear those two deny their crime. Considering all this, I think Macbeth has handled things well. If he had Duncan’s sons in prison—which I hope won’t happen—they would find out how awful the punishment is for those who kill their fathers, and so would Fleance. But enough of that. I hear that Macduff is out of favor with the king because he No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -43- Original Text Modern Text failed His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell Where he bestows himself? speaks his mind too plainly, and because he failed to show up at Macbeth’s feast. Can you tell me where he’s hiding himself? 25 30 35 LORD The son of Duncan— From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth— Lives in the English court and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward, That by the help of these—with Him above To ratify the work—we may again Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights, Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives, Do faithful homage and receive free honors. All which we pine for now. And this report Hath so exasperated the king that he Prepares for some attempt of war. LORD Duncan’s son Malcolm, whose birthright and throne Macbeth has stolen, lives in the English court. There, the saintly King Edward treats Malcolm so well that despite Malcolm’s misfortunes, he’s not deprived of respect. Macduff went there to ask King Edward for help. He wants Edward to help him form an alliance with the people of Northumberland and their lord, Siward. Macduff hopes that with their help—and with the help of God above—he may once again put food on our tables, bring peace back to our nights, free our feasts and banquets from violent murders, allow us to pay proper homage to our king, and receive honors freely. Those are the things we pine for now. Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he’s preparing for war. Act 3, Scene 6, Page 2 40 LENNOX Sent he to Macduff? LENNOX Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland? LORD He did, and with an absolute “Sir, not I,” The cloudy messenger turns me his back, And hums, as who should say “You’ll rue the time That clogs me with this answer.” LORD He did, but Macduff told the messenger, “No way.” The messenger scowled and rudely turned his back on Macduff, as if to say, “You’ll regret the day you gave me this answer.” 45 50 LENNOX And that well might Advise him to a caution, t' hold what distance His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come, that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed! LENNOX That might well keep Macduff away from Scotland. Some holy angel should go to the court of England and give Macduff a message. He should return quickly to free our country, which is suffering under a tyrant! LORD I’ll send my prayers with him. LORD I’ll send my prayers with him. Exeunt They exit. Act 4, Scene 1 A cavern.

Act 4, Scene 2 Enter LADY MACDUFF, her SON, and ROSS LADY MACDUFF, her SON, and ROSS enter. LADY MACDUFF What had he done to make him fly the land? LADY MACDUFF What did he do that made him flee this land? ROSS You must have patience, madam. ROSS You have to be patient, madam. LADY MACDUFF He had none. His flight was madness. When our actions do not, Our fears do make us traitors. LADY MACDUFF He had no patience. He was crazy to run away. Even if you’re not a traitor, you’re going to look like one if you run away. 5 ROSS You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear. ROSS You don’t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee. 10 LADY MACDUFF Wisdom! To leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly? He loves us not; He wants the natural touch. For the poor wren, The most diminutive of birds, will fight, Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. All is the fear and nothing is the love, As little is the wisdom, where the flight So runs against all reason. LADY MACDUFF How could it be wisdom! To leave his wife, his children, his house, and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it! He doesn’t love us. He lacks the natural instinct to protect his family. Even the fragile wren, the smallest of birds, will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest. His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love. And since it’s so unreasonable for him to run away, it has nothing to do with wisdom either. 15 20 25 ROSS My dearest coz, I pray you school yourself. But for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o' th' season. I dare not speak much further; But cruel are the times when we are traitors And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor From what we fear, yet know not what we fear, But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and none. I take my leave of you. Shall not be long but I’ll be here again. Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward To what they were before.—My pretty cousin, Blessing upon you. ROSS My dearest relative, I’m begging you, pull yourself together. As for your husband, he is noble, wise, and judicious, and he understands what the times require. It’s not safe for me to say much more than this, but times are bad when people get denounced as traitors and don’t even know why. In times like these, we believe frightening rumors but we don’t even know what we’re afraid of. It’s like being tossed around on the ocean in every direction, and finally getting nowhere. I’ll say good-bye now. It won’t be long before I’m back. When things are at their worst they have to stop, or else improve to the way things were before.

LADY MACDUFF What, with worms and flies? LADY MACDUFF What? Are you going to start eating worms and flies? SON With what I get, I mean, and so do they. SON I mean I will live on whatever I get, like birds do. 35 LADY MACDUFF Poor bird! Thou ’dst never fear the net nor lime, The pitfall nor the gin. LADY MACDUFF You’d be a pitiful bird. You wouldn’t know enough to be afraid of traps. SON Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for. My father is not dead, for all your saying. SON Why should I be afraid of them, Mother? If I’m a pitiful bird, like you say, hunters won’t want me. No matter what you say, my father is not dead. LADY MACDUFF Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father? LADY MACDUFF Yes, he is dead. What are you going to do for a father? 40 SON Nay, how will you do for a husband? SON Maybe you should ask, what will you do for a husband? LADY MACDUFF Why, I can buy me twenty at any market. LADY MACDUFF Oh, I can buy twenty husbands at any market. Act 4, Scene 2, Page 3 SON Then you’ll buy 'em to sell again. SON If so, you’d be buying them to sell again. LADY MACDUFF Thou speak’st with all thy wit; and yet, i' faith, With wit enough for thee. LADY MACDUFF You talk like a child, but you’re very smart anyway. 45 SON Was my father a traitor, Mother? SON Was my father a traitor, Mother? LADY MACDUFF Ay, that he was. LADY MACDUFF Yes, he was. SON What is a traitor? SON What is a traitor? LADY MACDUFF LADY MACDUFF No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -51- Original Text Modern Text Why, one that swears and lies. Someone who makes a promise and breaks it. SON And be all traitors that do so? SON And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor? 50 LADY MACDUFF Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged. LADY MACDUFF Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged. SON And must they all be hanged that swear and lie? SON And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged? LADY MACDUFF Every one. LADY MACDUFF Everyone. SON Who must hang them? SON Who should hang them? LADY MACDUFF Why, the honest men. LADY MACDUFF The honest men. 55 SON Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and swearers enough to beat the honest men and hang up them. SON Then the liars are fools, for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them. LADY MACDUFF Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father? LADY MACDUFF (laughing) Heaven help you for saying that, boy!(sad again) But what will you do without a father? SON If he were dead, you’d weep for him. If you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father. SON If he were dead, you’d be weeping for him. If you aren’t weeping, it’s a good sign that I’ll soon have a new father. LADY MACDUFF Poor prattler, how thou talk’st! LADY MACDUFF Silly babbler, how you talk! Act 4, Scene 2, Page 4 Enter a MESSENGER A MESSENGER enters. 60 65 MESSENGER Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known, Though in your state of honor I am perfect. I doubt some danger does approach you nearly. If you will take a homely man’s advice, Be not found here. Hence with your little ones. To fright you thus methinks I am too savage; To do worse to you were fell cruelty, Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! I dare abide no longer. MESSENGER Bless you, fair lady! You don’t know me, but I know you’re an important person. I’m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you. If you’ll take a simple man’s advice, don’t be here when it arrives. Go away and take your children. I feel bad for scaring you like this, but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm. And harm is getting close! Heaven keep you safe! Exit The MESSENGER exits. 70 LADY MACDUFF Whither should I fly? I have done no harm. But I remember now I am in this earthly world, where to do harm Is often laudable, to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas, Do I put up that womanly defense, To say I have done no harm? LADY MACDUFF Where should I go? I haven’t done anything wrong. But I have to remember that I’m here on Earth, where doing evil is often praised, and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake. So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I’m innocent? No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -52- Original Text Modern Text Enter MURDERERS The MURDERERS enter. What are these faces? Who are these men? 75 FIRST MURDERER Where is your husband? FIRST MURDERER Where is your husband?

Act 4, Scene 3 Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF MALCOLM and MACDUFF enter. MALCOLM Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty. MALCOLM Let’s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out. MACDUFF Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men, Bestride our downfall'n birthdom. Each new morn New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out Like syllable of dolor. MACDUFF Instead of crying, let’s keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men. Each day new widows howl, new orphans cry, and new sorrows slap heaven in the face, until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland’s anguish and screams in pain. 10 15 MALCOLM What I believe I’ll wail; What know believe, and what I can redress, As I shall find the time to friend, I will. What you have spoke, it may be so perchance. This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest. You have loved him well. He hath not touched you yet. I am young, but something You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb T' appease an angry god. MALCOLM I will avenge whatever I believe is wrong. And I’ll believe whatever I’m sure is true. And I’ll put right whatever I can when the time comes. What you just said may perhaps be true. This tyrant, whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it, was once considered an honest man. You were one of his favorites. He hasn’t done anything to harm you yet. I’m inexperienced, but maybe you’re planning to win Macbeth’s favor by betraying me to him. It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth. MACDUFF I am not treacherous. MACDUFF I am not treacherous. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -53- Original Text Modern Text 20 25 MALCOLM But Macbeth is. A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon. That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose. Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell. Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, Yet grace must still look so. MALCOLM But Macbeth is. Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command. But I beg your pardon. My fears can’t actually make you evil. Angels are still bright even though Lucifer, the brightest angel, fell from heaven. Even though everything evil wants to look good, good still has to look good too. Act 4, Scene 3, Page 2 MACDUFF I have lost my hopes. MACDUFF I have lost my hope of convincing you to fight against Macbeth. 30 MALCOLM Perchance even there where I did find my doubts. Why in that rawness left you wife and child, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave-taking? I pray you, Let not my jealousies be your dishonors, But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just, Whatever I shall think. MALCOLM Maybe you lost your hopes about me where I found my doubts about you. Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable—the most precious things in your life, those strong bonds of love? How could you leave them behind? But I beg you, don’t interpret my suspicions as slander against you. You must understand that I want to protect myself. You may really be honest, no matter what I think. 35 MACDUFF Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure, For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy wrongs; The title is affeered.—Fare thee well, lord. I would not be the villain that thou think’st For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp, And the rich East to boot. MACDUFF Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyrant, go ahead and build yourself up, because good people are afraid to stand up to you. Enjoy everything you stole, because your title is safe! Farewell, lord. I wouldn’t be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth’s kingdom and the riches of the East too. 40 45 50 MALCOLM Be not offended. I speak not as in absolute fear of you. I think our country sinks beneath the yoke. It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds. I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands. But, for all this, When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head, Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before, More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever, By him that shall succeed. MALCOLM Don’t be offended. I don’t completely distrust you. I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth’s oppression. Our country weeps, it bleeds, and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds. I also think there would be many people willing to fight for me. The English have promised me thousands of troops. But even so, when I have Macbeth’s head under my foot, or stuck on the end of my sword, then my poor country will be plagued by worse evil than it was before. It will suffer worse and in more ways than ever under the reign of the king who follows Macbeth. MACDUFF What should he be? MACDUFF Who are you talking about? Act 4, Scene 3, Page 3 MALCOLM It is myself I mean, in whom I know MALCOLM I’m talking about myself. I know I have so many No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -54- Original Text Modern Text 55 All the particulars of vice so grafted That, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb, being compared With my confineless harms. vices that when people see all of them exposed, evil Macbeth will seem as pure as snow in comparison, and poor Scotland will call him a sweet lamb when they compare him to me and my infinite evils. MACDUFF Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damned In evils to top Macbeth. MACDUFF Even in hell you couldn’t find a devil worse than Macbeth. 60 65 MALCOLM I grant him bloody, Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name. But there’s no bottom, none, In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters, Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up The cistern of my lust, and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign. MALCOLM I admit that he’s murderous, lecherous, greedy, lying, deceitful, violent, malicious, and guilty of every sin that has a name. But there is no end, absolutely none, to my sexual desires. Your wives, your daughters, your old women, and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust. My desire would overpower all restraints and anyone who stood in my way. It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me. 70 75 MACDUFF Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny. It hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings. But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours. You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty And yet seem cold; the time you may so hoodwink. We have willing dames enough. There cannot be That vulture in you to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves, Finding it so inclined. MACDUFF Endless greed and lust in a man’s nature is a kind of tyranny. It has caused the downfall of many kings. But don’t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you. You can find a way to satisfy your desires in secret, while still appearing virtuous. You can deceive everyone. There are more than enough willing women around. Your lust can’t possibly be so strong that you’d use up all the women willing to give themselves to the king once they find out he wants them. Act 4, Scene 3, Page 4 80 85 MALCOLM With this there grows In my most ill-composed affection such A stanchless avarice that, were I king, I should cut off the nobles for their lands, Desire his jewels and this other’s house. And my more-having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more, that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, Destroying them for wealth. MALCOLM Along with being full of lust, I’m also incredibly greedy. If I became king, I would steal the nobles' lands, taking jewels from one guy and houses from another. The more I had, the greedier I would grow, until I’d invent false quarrels with my good and loyal subjects, destroying them so I could get my hands on their wealth. 90 MACDUFF This avarice Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear; Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will, Of your mere own. All these are portable, With other graces weighed. MACDUFF The greed you’re talking about is worse than lust because you won’t outgrow it. Greed has been the downfall of many kings. But don’t be afraid. Scotland has enough treasures to satisfy you out of your own royal coffers. These bad qualities are bearable when balanced against your good sides. MALCOLM MALCOLM No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -55- Original Text Modern Text 95 100 But I have none. The king-becoming graces, As justice, verity, temperance, stableness, Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, I have no relish of them but abound In the division of each several crime, Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth. But I don’t have any good sides. I don’t have a trace of the qualities a king needs, such as justice, truth, moderation, stability, generosity, perseverance, mercy, humility, devotion, patience, courage, and bravery. Instead, I overflow with every variation of all the different vices. No, if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell. MACDUFF O Scotland, Scotland! MACDUFF Oh Scotland, Scotland! MALCOLM If such a one be fit to govern, speak. I am as I have spoken. MALCOLM If someone like me is fit to be king, let me know. I really am exactly as I have described myself to you. Act 4, Scene 3, Page 5 105 110 115 MACDUFF Fit to govern? No, not to live.—O nation miserable, With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered, When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again, Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accursed, And does blaspheme his breed?—Thy royal father Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee, Oftener upon her knees than on her feet, Died every day she lived. Fare thee well! These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself Have banished me from Scotland.—O my breast, Thy hope ends here! MACDUFF (to MALCOLM) Fit to be king? You’re not fit to live!—Oh miserable nation, ruled by a usurping, murderous tyrant, when will you see peaceful days again? The man who has a legal right to the throne is, by his own admission, a cursed man and a disgrace to the royal family.—Your royal father Duncan was a virtuous king. Your mother spent more time on her knees in prayer than she did standing up, and she lived a life of absolute piety. Good-bye. The evils you have described inside yourself have driven me out of Scotland forever. Oh my heart, your hope is dead! 120 125 130 MALCOLM Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me From overcredulous haste. But God above Deal between thee and me, for even now I put myself to thy direction and Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself, For strangers to my nature. I am yet Unknown to woman, never was forsworn, Scarcely have coveted what was mine own, At no time broke my faith, would not betray The devil to his fellow, and delight No less in truth than life. My first false speaking Was this upon myself. What I am truly, Is thine and my poor country’s to command. MALCOLM Macduff, this passionate outburst, which proves your integrity, has removed my doubts about you and made me realize that you really are trustworthy and honorable. That devil Macbeth has tried many times to trick me and lure me into his power, and prudence prevents me from believing people too quickly. But with God as my witness, I will let myself be guided by you, and I take back my confession. I take back all the bad things I said about myself, because none of those flaws are really part of my character. I’m still a virgin. I have never told a lie. I barely care about what I already own, let alone feel jealous of another’s possessions. I have never broken a promise. I wouldn’t betray the devil himself. I love truth as much as I love life. The lies I told about my character are actually the first false words I have ever spoken. The person who I really am is ready to serve you and our poor country. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -56- Original Text Modern Text Act 4, Scene 3, Page 6 135 Whither indeed, before thy here-approach, Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men, Already at a point, was setting forth. Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent? Indeed, before you arrived here, old Siward, with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle, was making his way here. Now we will fight Macbeth together, and may the chances of our success be as great as the justice of our cause! Why are you silent? 140 MACDUFF Such welcome and unwelcome things at once 'Tis hard to reconcile. MACDUFF It’s hard to make sense of such different stories. Enter a DOCTOR A DOCTOR enters. MALCOLM Well, more anon.—Comes the king forth, I pray you? MALCOLM Well, we’ll speak more soon. (to the DOCTOR)Is King Edward coming out? 145 DOCTOR Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure. Their malady convinces The great assay of art, but at his touch— Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand— They presently amend. DOCTOR Yes, sir. A crowd of sick people is waiting for him to heal them. Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine, but when he touches them, they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven. MALCOLM I thank you, doctor. MALCOLM Thank you, doctor. Exit DOCTOR The DOCTOR exits. MACDUFF What’s the disease he means? MACDUFF What disease is he talking about? 150 155 MALCOLM 'Tis called the evil. A most miraculous work in this good king, Which often since my here-remain in England I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven, Himself best knows, but strangely visited people, All swoll'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, The mere despair of surgery, he cures, Hanging a golden stamp about their necks, Put on with holy prayers. And, ’tis spoken, MALCOLM It’s called the evil. Edward’s healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England. How he receives these gifts from heaven, only he can say. But he cures people with strange conditions—all swollen, plagued by ulcers, and pitiful to look at, patients who are beyond the help of surgery—by placing a gold coin around their necks and saying holy prayers over them. Act 4, Scene 3, Page 7 160 To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction. With this strange virtue, He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, And sundry blessings hang about his throne, That speak him full of grace. They say that he bequeaths this ability to heal to his royal descendants. Along with this strange power, he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities. All of these signs mark him as a man graced by God. Enter ROSS ROSS enters. MACDUFF See, who comes here? MACDUFF Who’s that coming over here? MALCOLM My countryman, but yet I know him not. MALCOLM By his dress I can tell he’s my countryman, but I don’t recognize him. MACDUFF My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither. MACDUFF My noble kinsman, welcome. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -57- Original Text Modern Text 165 MALCOLM I know him now.—Good God, betimes remove The means that makes us strangers! MALCOLM I recognize him now. May God alter the circumstances that keep us apart! ROSS Sir, amen. ROSS Hello, sir. MACDUFF Stands Scotland where it did? MACDUFF Is Scotland the same as when I left it? 170 175 ROSS Alas, poor country! Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot Be called our mother, but our grave, where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell Is there scarce asked for who, and good men’s lives Expire before the flowers in their caps, Dying or ere they sicken. ROSS Alas, our poor country! It’s too frightened to look at itself. Scotland is no longer the land where we were born; it’s the land where we’ll die. Where no one ever smiles except for the fool who knows nothing. Where sighs, groans, and shrieks rip through the air but no one notices. Where violent sorrow is a common emotion. When the funeral bells ring, people no longer ask who died. Good men die before the flowers in their caps wilt. They die before they even fall sick. MACDUFF Oh, relation Too nice and yet too true! MACDUFF Oh, your report is too poetic, but it sounds so true! Act 4, Scene 3, Page 8 MALCOLM What’s the newest grief? MALCOLM What is the most recent news? ROSS That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker. Each minute teems a new one. ROSS Even news an hour old is old news. Every minute another awful thing happens. MACDUFF How does my wife? MACDUFF How is my wife? ROSS Why, well. ROSS She’s well. MACDUFF And all my children? MACDUFF And all my children? ROSS Well too. ROSS They’re well too. 180 MACDUFF The tyrant has not battered at their peace? MACDUFF Macbeth hasn’t attacked them? ROSS No, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em. ROSS They were at peace when I left them. MACDUFF Be not a niggard of your speech. How goes ’t? MACDUFF Don’t be stingy with your words. What’s the news? 185 ROSS When I came hither to transport the tidings, Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor Of many worthy fellows that were out; Which was to my belief witnessed the rather For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot. Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland ROSS While I was coming here to tell you my sad news, I heard rumors that many good men are arming themselves to rebel against Macbeth. When I saw Macbeth’s army on the move, I knew the rumors must be true. Now is the time when we need your help. Your presence in Scotland No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -58- Original Text Modern Text 190 Would create soldiers, make our women fight, To doff their dire distresses. would inspire people to fight. Even the women would fight to rid themselves of Macbeth’s oppression. MALCOLM Be ’t their comfort We are coming thither. Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out. MALCOLM Let them be comforted—I’m returning to Scotland. Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers. There is no soldier more experienced or successful than Siward in the entire Christian world. Act 4, Scene 3, Page 9 195 ROSS Would I could answer This comfort with the like. But I have words That would be howled out in the desert air, Where hearing should not latch them. ROSS I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own. But I have some news that should be howled in a barren desert where nobody can hear it. MACDUFF What concern they? The general cause, or is it a fee-grief Due to some single breast? MACDUFF What is this news about? Does it affect all of us? Or just one of us? 200 ROSS No mind that’s honest But in it shares some woe, though the main part Pertains to you alone. ROSS No decent man can keep from sharing in the sorrow, but my news affects you alone. MACDUFF If it be mine, Keep it not from me. Quickly let me have it. MACDUFF If it’s for me, don’t keep it from me. Let me have it now. 205 ROSS Let not your ears despise my tongue forever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard. ROSS I hope you won’t hate me forever after I say these things, because I will soon fill your ears with the most dreadful news you have ever heard. MACDUFF Hum! I guess at it. MACDUFF I think I can guess what you’re about to say. 210 ROSS Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered. To relate the manner, Were, on the quarry of these murdered deer To add the death of you. ROSS Your castle was attacked. Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered. If I told you how they were killed, it would cause you so much pain that it would kill you too, and add your body to the pile of murdered corpses. MALCOLM Merciful heaven! What, man! Ne'er pull your hat upon your brows. Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break. MALCOLM Merciful heaven! (to MACDUFF) Come on, man, don’t keep your grief hidden. Put your sorrow into words. The grief you keep inside you will whisper in your heart until it breaks. MACDUFF My children too? MACDUFF They killed my children too? 215 ROSS Wife, children, servants, all that could be found. ROSS They killed your wife, your children, your servants, anyone they could find.

My wife was killed too? ROSS I have said. ROSS I said she was. 220 MALCOLM Be comforted. Let’s make us med'cines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief. MALCOLM Take comfort. Let’s cure this awful grief by taking revenge on Macbeth. 225 MACDUFF He has no children. All my pretty ones? Did you say all? O hell-kite! All? What, all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop? MACDUFF He doesn’t have children. All my pretty little children? Did you say all? Oh, that bird from hell! All of them? What, all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop? MALCOLM Dispute it like a man. MALCOLM Fight it like a man. 230 MACDUFF I shall do so, But I must also feel it as a man. I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on, And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now. MACDUFF I will. But I also have to feel it like a man. I can’t help remembering the things that were most precious to me. Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help? Sinful Macduff, they were killed because of you! As wicked as I am, they were slaughtered because of me, not because of anything they did. May God give their souls rest. 235 MALCOLM Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief Convert to anger. Blunt not the heart, enrage it. MALCOLM Let this anger sharpen your sword. Transform your grief into anger. Don’t block the feelings in your heart; let them loose as rage. 240 MACDUFF Oh, I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission. Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself. Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scape, Heaven forgive him too. MACDUFF I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them! But gentle heavens, don’t keep me waiting. Bring me face to face with Macbeth, that devil of Scotland. Put him within the reach of my sword, and if he escapes, may heaven forgive him as well! Act 4, Scene 3, Page 11 245 MALCOLM This tune goes manly. Come, go we to the king. Our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may. The night is long that never finds the day. MALCOLM Now you sound like a man. Come on, let’s go see King Edward. The army is ready. All we have to do now is say goodbye to the king. Macbeth is ripe for the picking. We’ll be acting as God’s agents. Cheer up as much as you can. A new day will come at last. Exeunt They exit.

DOCTOR I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked? DOCTOR I’ve stayed up with you for two nights now, and I haven’t seen any evidence of what you were talking about. When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking? GENTLEWOMAN Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep. GENTLEWOMAN Since Macbeth went to war, I have seen her rise from her bed, put on her nightgown, unlock her closet, take out some paper, fold it, write on it, read it, seal it up, and then return to bed, remaining asleep the entire time. DOCTOR A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the line>effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say? DOCTOR It’s unnatural to be asleep and act as if you’re awake. When she is like this, besides walking and performing various activities, have you heard her say anything? GENTLEWOMAN That, sir, which I will not report after her. GENTLEWOMAN She says something, sir, but I will not repeat it to you. DOCTOR You may to me, and ’tis most meet you should. DOCTOR You can tell me. You really should.

DOCTOR What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands. DOCTOR What’s she doing now? Look how she rubs her hands. 20 GENTLEWOMAN It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour. GENTLEWOMAN She often does that. She looks like she’s washing her hands. I’ve seen her do that before for as long as fifteen minutes. LADY MACBETH LADY MACBETH No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -61- Original Text Modern Text Yet here’s a spot. There’s still a spot here. DOCTOR Hark! She speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly. DOCTOR Listen! She’s talking. I’ll write down what she says, so I’ll remember it better. 25 LADY MACBETH Out, damned spot! Out, I say!—One, two. Why, then, ’tis time to do ’t. Hell is murky!—Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?—Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him. LADY MACBETH (rubbing her hands) Come out, damned spot! Out, I command you! One, two. OK, it’s time to do it now.—Hell is murky!—Nonsense, my lord, nonsense! You are a soldier, and yet you are afraid? Why should we be scared, when no one can lay the guilt upon us?—But who would have thought the old man would have had so much blood in him? DOCTOR Do you mark that? DOCTOR Did you hear that? 30 LADY MACBETH The thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?— What, will these hands ne'er be clean?—No more o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all with this starting. LADY MACBETH The thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What, will my hands never be clean?—No more of that, my lord, no more of that. You’ll ruin everything by acting startled like this. DOCTOR Go to, go to. You have known what you should not. DOCTOR Now look what you’ve done. You’ve heard something you shouldn’t have. Act 5, Scene 1, Page 3 GENTLEWOMAN She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has known. GENTLEWOMAN She said something she shouldn’t have said, I’m sure of that. Heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping. LADY MACBETH Here’s the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, Oh, Oh! LADY MACBETH I still have the smell of blood on my hand. All the perfumes of Arabia couldn’t make my little hand smell better. Oh, oh, oh! DOCTOR What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged. DOCTOR What a heavy sigh! Her heart is carrying a heavy weight. GENTLEWOMAN I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body. GENTLEWOMAN I wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen. DOCTOR Well, well, well. DOCTOR Well, well, well. GENTLEWOMAN Pray God it be, sir. GENTLEWOMAN I hope what she’s saying is well, sir! 40 DOCTOR This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds. DOCTOR This disease is beyond my medical skills. But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren’t guilty of anything. LADY MACBETH Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown. Look not so pale.—I tell you yet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on ’s grave. LADY MACBETH Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown. Don’t look so frightened. I tell you again, Banquo is buried. He cannot come out of his grave. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -62- Original Text Modern Text DOCTOR Even so? DOCTOR Is this true? 45 LADY MACBETH To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone.—To bed, to bed, to bed!

DOCTOR Will she go now to bed? DOCTOR Will she go to bed now? Act 5, Scene 1, Page 4 GENTLEWOMAN Directly. GENTLEWOMAN Yes, right away. 50 55 DOCTOR Foul whisp'rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets. More needs she the divine than the physician. God, God forgive us all! Look after her, Remove from her the means of all annoyance, And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night. My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight. I think, but dare not speak. DOCTOR Evil rumors are going around. Unnatural acts will cause supernatural things to happen. People with guilty and deranged minds will confess their secrets to their pillows as they sleep. This woman needs a priest more than a doctor. God forgive us all! (to the waiting- GENTLEWOMAN)Look after her. Remove anything she might hurt herself with. Watch her constantly. And now, good-night. She has bewildered my mind and amazed my eyes. I have an opinion, but I don’t dare to say it out loud. GENTLEWOMAN Good night, good doctor. GENTLEWOMAN Good night, good doctor. Exeunt They exit. Act 5, Scene 2 Drum and colors. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS,ANGUS, LENNOX, and soldiers MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and soldiers enter with a drummer and flag. 5 MENTEITH The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward and the good Macduff. Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man. MENTEITH The English army is near, led by Malcolm, his uncle Siward, and the good Macduff. They burn for revenge. The wrongs they have suffered would make dead men rise up and fight. ANGUS Near Birnam Wood Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming. ANGUS We’ll meet them near Birnam Wood. They are coming that way. CAITHNESS Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother? CAITHNESS Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother? 10 LENNOX For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file Of all the gentry. There is Siward’s son, And many unrough youths that even now Protest their first of manhood. LENNOX He is definitely not there, sir. I have a list of all the important men. Siward’s son is there, as well as many boys too young to have beards who will become men by joining in this battle. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -63- Original Text Modern Text MENTEITH What does the tyrant? MENTEITH What is the tyrant Macbeth doing? 15 CAITHNESS Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies. Some say he’s mad, others that lesser hate him Do call it valiant fury. But, for certain, He cannot buckle his distempered cause Within the belt of rule. CAITHNESS He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses. Some say he’s insane. Those who hate him less call it brave anger. One thing is certain: he’s out of control. 20 ANGUS Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands. Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach. Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe Upon a dwarfish thief. ANGUS Now Macbeth feels the blood of his murdered enemies sticking to his hands. Now, rebel armies punish him every minute for his treachery. The soldiers he commands are only following orders. They don’t fight because they love Macbeth. Now he seems too small to be a great king, like a midget trying to wear the robes of a giant. Act 5, Scene 2, Page 2 25 MENTEITH Who then shall blame His pestered senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there? MENTEITH Who can blame him for acting crazy, when inside he condemns himself for everything he’s done? CAITHNESS Well, march we on, To give obedience where ’tis truly owed. Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal, And with him pour we in our country’s purge Each drop of us. CAITHNESS Well, let’s keep marching and give our loyalty to someone who truly deserves it. We’re going to meet Malcolm, the doctor who will cure our sick country. We’ll pour out our own blood to help him. 30 LENNOX Or so much as it needs, To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds. Make we our march towards Birnam. LENNOX However much blood we need to give to water the royal flower and drown the weeds—to make Malcolm king and get rid of Macbeth. Let’s proceed on our march to Birnam. Exeunt, marching They exit, marching. Act 5, Scene 3 Enter MACBETH, DOCTOR, and attendants MACBETH, a DOCTOR, and attendants enter. 10 MACBETH Bring me no more reports. Let them fly all. Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm? Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus: “Fear not, Macbeth. No man that’s born of woman Shall e'er have power upon thee.” Then fly, false thanes, And mingle with the English epicures. The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear. MACBETH Don’t bring me any more reports. I don’t care if all the thanes desert me. Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane, I won’t be affected by fear. What’s the boy Malcolm? Wasn’t he born from a woman? The spirits that know the future have told me this: “Don’t be afraid, Macbeth. No man born from a woman will ever defeat you.” So get out of here, disloyal thanes, and join the weak and decadent English! My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear. Enter a SERVANT A SERVANT enters. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -64- Original Text Modern Text The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon! Where got’st thou that goose look? May the devil turn you black, you white-faced fool! Why do you look like a frightened goose? SERVANT There is ten thousand— SERVANT There are ten thousand— MACBETH Geese, villain? MACBETH Geese, you idiot? 15 SERVANT Soldiers, sir. SERVANT Soldiers, sir. MACBETH Go, prick thy face and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-livered boy. What soldiers, patch? Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face? MACBETH Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face, you cowardly boy. What soldiers, fool? Curse you! That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well. What soldiers, milk- face? 20 SERVANT The English force, so please you. SERVANT The English army, sir. MACBETH Take thy face hence. MACBETH Get out of my sight. Exit SERVANT The SERVANT exits. Act 5, Scene 3, Page 2 25 30 Seyton!—I am sick at heart, When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now. I have lived long enough. My way of life Is fall'n into the sere, the yellow leaf, And that which should accompany old age, As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends, I must not look to have, but, in their stead, Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not. Seyton! Seyton!—I’m sick at heart when I see—Seyton, come here!—This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne. I have lived long enough. The course of my life is beginning to wither and fall away, like a yellowing leaf in autumn. The things that should go along with old age, like honor, love, obedience, and loyal friends, I cannot hope to have. Instead, I have passionate but quietly whispered curses, people who honor me with their words but not in their hearts, and lingering life, which my heart would gladly end, though I can’t bring myself to do it. Seyton! Enter SEYTON SEYTON enters. SEYTON What’s your gracious pleasure? SEYTON What do you want? MACBETH What news more? MACBETH Is there more news? SEYTON All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported. SEYTON All the rumors have been confirmed. MACBETH I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked. Give me my armor. MACBETH I’ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones. Give me my armor. 35 SEYTON 'Tis not needed yet. SEYTON You don’t need it yet. MACBETH I’ll put it on. Send out more horses. Skirr the country round. Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor. How does your patient, doctor? MACBETH I’ll put it on anyway. Send out more cavalry. Scour the whole country and hang anyone spreading fear. Give me my armor. (to the DOCTOR) How is my wife, doctor? No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -65- Original Text Modern Text 40 DOCTOR Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies That keep her from her rest. DOCTOR She is not sick, my lord, but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping. Act 5, Scene 3, Page 3 45 MACBETH Cure her of that. Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased, Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, Raze out the written troubles of the brain And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart? MACBETH Cure her of that. Can’t you treat a diseased mind? Take away her memory of sorrow? Use some drug to erase the troubling thoughts from her brain and ease her heart? DOCTOR Therein the patient Must minister to himself. DOCTOR For that kind of relief, the patient must heal herself. 50 55 MACBETH Throw physic to the dogs; I’ll none of it. Come, put mine armor on. Give me my staff. Seyton, send out.—Doctor, the thanes fly from me. Come, sir, dispatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast The water of my land, find her disease, And purge it to a sound and pristine health, I would applaud thee to the very echo, That should applaud again.—Pull ’t off, I say.— What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug, Would scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of them? MACBETH Medicine is for the dogs. I won’t have anything to do with it. (to SEYTON) Come, put my armor on me. Give me my lance. Seyton, send out the soldiers. (to the DOCTOR) Doctor, the thanes are running away from me. (to SEYTON) Come on, sir, hurry. (to the DOCTOR) Can you figure out what’s wrong with my country? If you can diagnose its disease by examining its urine, and bring it back to health, I will praise you to the ends of the Earth, where the sound will echo back so you can hear the applause again.— (toSEYTON) Pull it off, I tell you. (to the DOCTOR)What drug would purge the English from this country? Have you heard of any? 60 DOCTOR Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation Makes us hear something. DOCTOR Yes, my good lord. Your preparation for war sounds like something. MACBETH Bring it after me. I will not be afraid of death and bane, Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane. MACBETH (to SEYTON) Bring the armor and follow me. I will not be afraid of death and destruction until Birnam forest picks itself up and moves to Dunsinane. DOCTOR (aside) Were I from Dunsinane away and clear, Profit again should hardly draw me here. DOCTOR (to himself) I wish I were far away from Dunsinane. You couldn’t pay me to come back here. Exeunt They exit. Act 5, Scene 4 Drum and colors.

MALCOLM Kinsmen, I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms. MENTEITH We doubt it nothing. MENTEITH We don’t doubt it. SIWARD What wood is this before us? SIWARD What’s the name of this forest behind us? MENTEITH The wood of Birnam. MENTEITH Birnam Wood. 5 MALCOLM Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear ’t before him. Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us. MALCOLM Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him. That way we can conceal how many of us there are, and Macbeth’s spies will give him inaccurate reports. SOLDIERS It shall be done. SOLDIERS We’ll do it. 1 SIWARD We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before ’t. SIWARD We have no news except that the overconfident Macbeth is still in Dunsinane and will allow us to lay siege to the castle. MALCOLM 'Tis his main hope: For, where there is advantage to be given, Both more and less have given him the revolt, And none serve with him but constrainèd things Whose hearts are absent too. MALCOLM He wants us to lay siege. Wherever his soldiers have an opportunity to leave him, they do, whatever rank they are. No one fights with him except men who are forced to, and their hearts aren’t in it. 1 MACDUFF Let our just censures Attend the true event, and put we on Industrious soldiership. MACDUFF We shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our goal. Let’s go fight like hardworking soldiers. Act 5, Scene 4, Page 2 20 SIWARD The time approaches That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have and what we owe. Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, But certain issue strokes must arbitrate. Towards which, advance the war. SIWARD Soon we’ll find out what’s really ours and what isn’t. It’s easy for us to get our hopes up just sitting around thinking about it, but the only way this is really going to be settled is by violence. So let’s move our armies forward. Exeunt, marching They exit, marching. Act 5, Scene 5 Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and SOLDIERS, with drum and colors MACBETH, SEYTON, and SOLDIERS enter with a drummer and flag. 5 MACBETH Hang out our banners on the outward walls. The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up. Were they not forced with those that should be ours, MACBETH Hang our flags on the outer walls. Everyone keeps yelling, “Here they come!” Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige. They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease. If it weren’t for the fact that so many of our No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -67- Original Text Modern Text We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home. soldiers revolted and joined them, we could have met them out in front of the castle, man to man, and beaten them back to England. A cry within of women A sound of women crying offstage. What is that noise? What’s that noise? SEYTON It is the cry of women, my good lord. SEYTON It’s women crying, my good lord. Exit SEYTON exits. 10 15 MACBETH I have almost forgot the taste of fears. The time has been my senses would have cooled To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in ’t. I have supped full with horrors. Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me. MACBETH I’ve almost forgotten what fear feels like. There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night, and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story. But now I’ve had my fill of real horrors. Horrible things are so familiar that they can’t startle me. Enter SEYTON SEYTON comes back in. Wherefore was that cry? What was that cry for? SEYTON The queen, my lord, is dead. SEYTON The queen is dead, my lord. Act 5, Scene 5, Page 2 20 25 MACBETH She should have died hereafter. There would have been a time for such a word. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. MACBETH She would have died later anyway. That news was bound to come someday. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. The days creep slowly along until the end of time. And every day that’s already happened has taken fools that much closer to their deaths. Out, out, brief candle. Life is nothing more than an illusion. It’s like a poor actor who struts and worries for his hour on the stage and then is never heard from again. Life is a story told by an idiot, full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning. Enter a MESSENGER A MESSENGER enters. Thou comest to use Thy tongue; thy story quickly. You’ve come to tell me something. Tell me quickly. 30 MESSENGER Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do ’t. MESSENGER My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I don’t know how to say it. MACBETH Well, say, sir. MACBETH Just say it. MESSENGER As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought The wood began to move. MESSENGER As I was standing watch on the hill, I looked toward Birnam, and I thought I saw the forest begin to move. MACBETH Liar and slave! MACBETH Liar and slave! MESSENGER MESSENGER No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -68- Original Text Modern Text 35 Let me endure your wrath, if ’t be not so. Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove. Punish me if it’s not true. Three miles from here you can see it coming, a moving forest. Act 5, Scene 5, Page 3 40 45 50 MACBETH If thou speak’st false, Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee. If thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much. I pull in resolution and begin To doubt th' equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnam wood Do come to Dunsinane”; and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!— If this which he avouches does appear, There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here. I 'gin to be aweary of the sun, And wish th' estate o' th' world were now undone.— Ring the alarum-bell!—Blow, wind! Come, wrack! At least we’ll die with harness on our back. MACBETH If you’re lying, I’ll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger. If what you say is true, you can do the same to me. (to himself) My confidence is failing. I’m starting to doubt the lies the devil told me, which sounded like truth. “Don’t worry until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane.” And now a wood is coming to Dunsinane. Prepare for battle, and go! If what this messenger says is true, it’s no use running away or staying here. I’m starting to grow tired of living, and I’d like to see the world plunged into chaos. Ring the alarms! Blow, wind! Come, ruin! At least we’ll die with our armor on. Exeunt They exit. Act 5, Scene 6 Drum and colors.

Your leafy screens throw down, And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle, Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son, Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon ’s what else remains to do, According to our order. MALCOLM We’re close enough now. Throw down these branches and show them who you really are. Uncle Siward, you and your son will lead the first battle. Brave Macduff and I will do the rest, according to our battle plan. SIWARD Fare you well. Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight, Let us be beaten if we cannot fight. SIWARD Good luck. If we meet Macbeth’s army tonight, let us be beaten if we cannot fight. 10 MACDUFF Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath, Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

MACBETH My name’s Macbeth. 10 YOUNG SIWARD The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear. YOUNG SIWARD The devil himself couldn’t say a name I hate more. MACBETH No, nor more fearful. MACBETH No, nor could the devil’s name be more frightening. YOUNG SIWARD Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant. With my sword I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st. YOUNG SIWARD You lie, you disgusting tyrant. I’ll prove with my sword that I’m not scared of you. They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is killed. 15 MACBETH Thou wast born of woman. But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandished by man that’s of a woman born. MACBETH You were born from a woman. Swords don’t frighten me.

I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth, Or else my sword with an unbattered edge I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be; By this great clatter, one of the greatest note Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune, And more I beg not. MACDUFF The noise is coming from over there. Tyrant, show your face! If someone other than me kills you, the ghosts of my wife and children will haunt me forever. I can’t be bothered to fight these lame soldiers who only fight for money. I’ll either fight you, Macbeth, or else I’ll put down my sword unused. You must be over there. By the great noise, it sounds like one of the highest-ranking men is being announced. I hope I find him! I ask for nothing more than that. Exit. Alarums MACDUFF exits. More battle noises. Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD MALCOLM and old SIWARD enter. 30 SIWARD This way, my lord. The castle’s gently rendered. The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight, The noble thanes do bravely in the war, The day almost itself professes yours, And little is to do. SIWARD Come this way, my lord. The castle has been surrendered without a fight. Macbeth’s soldiers are fighting on both sides. Our noblemen are battling bravely. The victory is almost yours, and it seems like there’s not much left to do.

As long as I see enemies of mine alive, I would rather see my sword wound them than me. Enter MACDUFF MACDUFF enters. MACDUFF Turn, hellhound, turn! MACDUFF Turn around, you dog from hell, turn around! 5 MACBETH Of all men else I have avoided thee. But get thee back. My soul is too much charged With blood of thine already. MACBETH You are the only man I have avoided. But go away now. I’m already guilty of killing your whole family. MACDUFF I have no words. My voice is in my sword. Thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out! MACDUFF I have nothing to say to you. My sword will talk for me. You are too evil for words! They fight They fight. 10 MACBETH Thou losest labor. As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed. Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; I bear a charmèd life, which must not yield To one of woman born. MACBETH You’re wasting your time trying to wound me. You might as well try to stab the air with your sword. Go fight someone who can be harmed. I lead a charmed life, which can’t be ended by anyone born from a woman. 15 MACDUFF Despair thy charm, And let the angel whom thou still hast served Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother’s womb Untimely ripped. MACDUFF You can forget about your charm. The evil spirit you serve can tell you that I was not born. They cut me out of my mother’s womb before she could bear me naturally. Act 5, Scene 8, Page 2 20 MACBETH Accursèd be that tongue that tells me so, For it hath cowed my better part of man! And be these juggling fiends no more believed, That palter with us in a double sense, That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope. I’ll not fight with thee. MACBETH Curse you for telling me this. You’ve fightened away my courage. I don’t believe those evil creatures anymore. They tricked me with their wordgames, raising my hopes and then destroying them. I won’t fight you. 25 MACDUFF Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o' th' time. We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted on a pole, and underwrit, MACDUFF Then surrender, coward, and we’ll put you in a freakshow, just like they do with deformed animals. We’ll put a picture of you on a sign, right above the words “Come see the tyrant!” No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -71- Original Text Modern Text “Here may you see the tyrant.” 30 MACBETH I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet, And to be baited with the rabble’s curse. Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou opposed, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last. Before my body I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff, And damned be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!” MACBETH I’m not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm, or be taunted by the common people. Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane, and I’m fighting a man not of woman born, I’ll fight to the end. I’ll put up my shield and battle you. Come on, let’s go at it, Macduff, and damn the first man who cries, 'Stop! Enough!' Exeunt, fighting. Alarums. They enter fighting, andMACBETH slain. Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colors MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, THANES, and SOLDIERS They exit fighting. Trumpets and battle noises. The trumpet of one army sounds a call to retreat. The other army’s trumpet sounds a call of victory. The victorious army enters, led by MALCOLM, old SIWARD, ROSS, the other THANES, and soldiers, with a drummer and flag. 35 MALCOLM I would the friends we miss were safe arrived. MALCOLM I wish all of our friends could have survived this battle. SIWARD Some must go off. And yet, by these I see, So great a day as this is cheaply bought. SIWARD In every battle, some people will always be killed, but judging from the men I see around us, our great victory didn’t cost us very much. MALCOLM Macduff is missing, and your noble son. MALCOLM Macduff is missing, and so is your noble son. 40 ROSS Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt. He only lived but till he was a man, The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed In the unshrinking station where he fought, But like a man he died. ROSS My lord, your son has paid the soldier’s price: death. He only lived long enough to become a man, and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one, he died. Act 5, Scene 8, Page 3 SIWARD Then he is dead? SIWARD So he’s dead? 45 ROSS Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, for then It hath no end. ROSS Yes, and he’s been carried off the field. Your grief should not be equal to his worth, because then your sorrow would never end. SIWARD Had he his hurts before? SIWARD Were his wounds on his front side? ROSS Ay, on the front. ROSS Yes, on his front. 50 SIWARD Why then, God’s soldier be he! Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death. And so, his knell is knolled. SIWARD Well then, he’s God’s soldier now! If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head, I couldn’t hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did. And that’s all there is to it. MALCOLM He’s worth more sorrow, And that I’ll spend for him. MALCOLM He is worth more mourning than that, and I will mourn for him. No Fear Shakespeare – Macbeth (by SparkNotes) -72- Original Text Modern Text SIWARD He’s worth no more. They say he parted well and paid his score. And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort. SIWARD He is worth no more than that. They tell me he died well, and settled his scores. With that, I hope God is with him! Here comes better news. Enter MACDUFF with MACBETH’s head MACDUFF enters, carrying MACBETH’s head. 55 MACDUFF Hail, king! For so thou art. Behold where stands The usurper’s cursèd head. The time is free. I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl, That speak my salutation in their minds, Whose voices I desire aloud with mine. Hail, King of Scotland! MACDUFF Hail, king! Because that’s what you are now. Look, here I have Macbeth’s cursed head. We are free from his tyranny. I see that you have the kingdom’s noblemen around you, and they’re thinking the same thing as me. I want them to join me in this loud cheer, Hail, King of Scotland! Act 5, Scene 8, Page 4 60 ALL Hail, King of Scotland! ALL Hail, King of Scotland! Flourish Trumpets play. 65 70 75 MALCOLM We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named. What’s more to do, Which would be planted newly with the time, As calling home our exiled friends abroad That fled the snares of watchful tyranny, Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen, Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands Took off her life; this, and what needful else That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, We will perform in measure, time, and place. So, thanks to all at once and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone. MALCOLM It won’t be long before I reward each of you as he deserves. My thanes and kinsmen, I name you all earls, the first earls that Scotland has ever had. We have a lot to do at the dawn of this new era. We must call home all of our exiled friends who fled from the grip of Macbeth’s tyranny, and we must bring to justice all the evil ministers of this dead butcher and his demon-like queen, who, rumor has it, committed suicide. This, and whatever else we are called to do by God, we will do at the right time and in the right place. So I thank you all, and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone. Flourish. Exeunt Trumpets play. They all exit.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
