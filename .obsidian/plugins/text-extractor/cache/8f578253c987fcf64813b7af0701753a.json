Research and planning [3–4] a reasonable rationale that links the research question and the claim The rationale shows that the research question is connected to the claim. However, the process by which the research question has been developed from the claim is not clearly shown. Are natural shampoos better cleaners than synthetic shampoos based on surface tension, wetting time, solid content, detergency and foaming ability? Claim Natural shampoos are better than synthetic shampoos. Rationale Body care products company Australian Biologika market their shampoo and conditioners as ‘caring for yourself … without the dangers of harmful chemicals … thus improving your health...’. (Buy Organics Online n.d.) The chemicals in the Biologika shampoo are claimed to be all natural and from organic sources. This would suggest that shampoos containing synthetic chemicals are in fact more toxic or damaging to the body. The most common reaction that people have to shampoos and other cosmetics is contact dermatitis (Seidu 2016). This can result in redness of the skin, scaly and itchy patches, burning sensations, as well as other Chemistry 2019 v1.3 IA3 high-level annotated sample response Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority August 2018 Page 7 of 13 Research and planning [5–6] a specific and relevant research question The research question is clearly defined and developed from the claim. The response clearly states the variables to be investigated. The research question is connected to the rationale and the topic of chemical synthesis and design. selection of sufficient and relevant sources Sources are scientific and provide enough evidence for the development of a scientific argument that responds to the research question. Research and planning [3–4] a reasonable rationale that links the research question and the claim Scientific literature shows the link between the research question and the claim. effects. Several sources (SLS Free n.d.) claim that the irritation is due to the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate, a surfactant found in shampoos. It is the surfactant that cleans the hair. Natural surfactants are found in yucca extract, soapwort and Quillaja bark extract. Ultimately, a shampoo needs to clean dirty hair; however, this is only one aspect to consider when deciding which shampoo to purchase. To determine whether a shampoo is effective at cleaning hair, it is essential to understand how the surfactants in a shampoo clean the hair and alter the properties of water to allow for cleaning to occur. The research question Are natural shampoos better cleaners than synthetic shampoos based on the properties of surface tension, wetting time, solid content, detergency and foaming ability? This review will use three studies from Badi & Khan (2014), Isaiah & Karthikeyan (2015) and Mainkar & Jolly (2001) that have been undertaken to determine the effectiveness of natural versus synthetic shampoos. The results of these studies will be compiled to investigate whether natural shampoos are better cleaners than synthetic shampoos. Background How does a shampoo clean hair? The dirt that needs to be removed is a mixture of dust, pollen and other particles that get trapped in the sebum. Sebum is a greasy substance that is produced in the sebaceous glands around the body, including the scalp, that have a role in protecting the hair and hair follicle (ThoughtCo. 2017). Approximately 41% of the ‘dirt’ is composed of wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%) and free fatty acids (~16%) (Thody & Shuster 1989). It is the long, aliphatic carbon chains of these molecules that makes them insoluble in water and, therefore, unable to be simply rinsed from the hair with water. When sodium lauryl sulfate is combined with water in dirty hair, the nonpolar aliphatic end of the molecule will dissolve in the sebum, which is also nonpolar. The hydrophilic (water-loving) end, the sulfate will form a sphere around the sebum and other non-polar molecules, forming a micelle. As the soluble, hydrophilic sulfate heads form the outer layer of the sphere and point towards the water, the micelle is now essentially water soluble. This means that the greasy substance can now be removed from the hair when rinsed with water (Cruzan 2012). Natural surfactants will work in the same way as the sodium lauryl sulfate, forming water soluble micelles that trap the sebum droplets and remove the dirt from the hair. Other components of a shampoo include thickeners, emulsifiers and perfumes, among others; however, it is the surfactants that do the cleaning.

It is applicable and directly connected to the formation of the scientific argument. thorough identification of relevant trends, patterns or relationships The response identifies trends, patterns or relationships that are not superficial or partial. The trends, patterns, or relationships have direct bearing upon and are applicable to the formation of the scientific argument. Analysis and interpretation [3–4] reasonable scientific argument/s The argument is sensible. However, it is not justified. Analysis and interpretation Natural vs. synthetic shampoos — a review of results The ability of a shampoo to clean hair can be judged on the surface tension, the amount of solid material present, the wetting time and the foam production. Three papers by Badi and Khan, Isaiah and Karthikeyan, and Mainkar and Jolly have reported the findings of tests between natural shampoos and commercially produced synthetic shampoos for several factors; however, not all factors were tested by all three reviews. The summarised relevant results to determine whether natural shampoos are better cleaners are presented in Table 1. The natural shampoos have been shaded for clarity. Table 1: Comparison of natural shampoos (shaded) and synthetic shampoos (Badi 2014) (Isaiah 2015) (Mainkar 2001) Formulated Shampoo Dove Herbal Essence Ego-cert Undisclosed synthetic shampoo Laboratory shampoo Average of five commercial shampoos Surface tension (dynes/cm) 38.72 31.68 38.36 32 34 37.1 32.8–37.7 Wetting time (sec) 187 141 157 130 159–227 Solid content (%) 22.75 25 25 25.3 26.5 Foam description Small dense Small dense Small airy Loose open Dense creamy Foam height (mL) 115 92 113 165 169 158 153–168 2% solution 1% solution Detergency (% sebum removal) 93 95 61.14 61.1– 80.12 Surface tension Surface tension in water is due to the intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonding) holding the water molecules together. This creates a skin-like effect on the surface of the water. The addition of a surfactant reduces the surface tension of the water, which enables the water to penetrate a surface, increasing access of the shampoo to the sebum to facilitate its removal. A higher surface tension means a reduced ability to clean the hair. Badi et. al. had a natural formulation that had a higher surface tension, 38.72dynes/cm, than both of the synthetic shampoos tested. The results from Manikar et. al. suggested the same, that the commercial (synthetic) shampoos were in fact better at reducing surface tension. Isaiah et. al. identified that the synthetic shampoo had a lower surface tension that Ego-cert, the natural shampoo. Only looking at surface tension from these three studies does not allow a judgement to be made about the ability of a natural shampoo to clean compared to a synthetic shampoo.

Analysis and interpretation [5–6] thorough and appropriate identification of limitations of evidence The response identifies limitations of evidence that affect how well it can be used to develop a response to the research question. Graph 1: Comparison of surface tensions of natural and synthetic shampoos Wetting time The wetting time is directly related to the amount of surfactant in the shampoo and consequently the surface tension of the water. The more surfactant that is present, the lower the surface tension, and the more quickly water will be absorbed into the material being cleaned — in this case, the hair. The results from Badi and Khan support this: Dove shampoo, a synthetic shampoo, with the lowest surface tension of 31.68 dynes/cm, had the quickest wetting time of 141 seconds. Mainkar and Jolly also tested wetting time, but from their research the relationship between wetting time and surface tension is inconclusive. This is primarily due to the combining of results of the commercial (synthetic) shampoos.

If it is too low, a shampoo will be too watery and wash away too quickly, leaving sebum in the hair; too high, and the shampoo will not rinse easily form the hair. All shampoos in the two studies that looked at solid content fell between these limits. Foaming ability Many think that a good shampoo is one that foams well (Draelos 2010). The ability of a shampoo to foam is not just based on the contents of the shampoo, but also the hardness of the water the shampoo is being used with. The foaming of a shampoo influences its ability to be spread through the hair, but it does not act to clean the hair. A higher foam column means more foam and, therefore, an increased distribution of shampoo through the hair. The three studies used different concentrations of shampoo in determining foam height and potentially had water of different hardness, but were consistent within their own studies. Again, the results are inconclusive as to whether the natural shampoo foamed more than the synthetic shampoo. Badi and Khan had a foam height slightly higher with the natural shampoo, Isaiah and Karthikeyan slightly higher with the synthetic shampoo. Again, there is no clarity of results in Mainkar and Jolly’s study due to the grouping of synthetic detergents, the natural shampoo sitting within the range produced by the synthetic shampoos. Graph 3: Comparison of foam column heights for shampoos Detergency Detergency has been measured as the percentage of sebum removed from the hair when washed with a solution of the shampoo. Isaiah and Karthikeyan used a 1% solution; the concentration of solution was not given in the other paper. In both studies, the performance of the synthetic shampoo was better than the natural shampoo; however, the difference in detergency is quite small and, therefore, not enough to make a definitive statement about the cleaning ability of the shampoo. Analysis and interpretation [5–6] thorough and appropriate identification of limitations of evidence The response identifies limitations of the evidence that are not superficial or partial. The limitations are suitable for determining the reliability of the evidence in responding to the research question. Analysis and interpretation [3–4] reasonable scientific argument/s The scientific argument is appropriate given the evidence. However, it is not justified as the argument has not been supported with evidence.

Badi and Khan (2014) and Isaiah and Karthikeyan (2015) contained detailed experimental procedures that could be replicated. However, these two papers used different techniques and concentrations of shampoo when conducting the tests. This limits the ability to compare the results of the two studies. Realistically, only their conclusions can be used. Mainkar and Jolly’s paper (2001) contains no detail of the preparation of solution, the concentrations of solution or the methods used to determine the results. Mainkar and Jolly also only reported the synthetic shampoo results grouped and averaged. This does not provide clarity in the comparison between natural and synthetic shampoos. This paper, therefore, does not add value to the discussion on the comparison of shampoos. All papers were published in journals, so their results are deemed to be reliable. It is the lack of consistent results in the three papers that leads to no decisive result about the cleaning ability of natural and synthetic shampoos. Conclusion and evaluation [5–6] insightful discussion of the quality of evidence The discussion shows understanding of the features of the evidence that affect its ability to be used to respond to the research question. justified conclusion/s linked to the research question The response uses sound reasoning and valid and reliable evidence to support conclusions that directly respond to the research question.

However, the findings suggest that the claim is false, i.e. natural shampoos are not better than synthetics. Conclusion and evaluation [5–6] suggested improvements and extensions to the investigation that are considered and relevant to the claim The improvements address the limitations associated with the evidence. The extensions identify modifications that would complement the findings of the investigation and have the potential to provide new evidence that could be used to evaluate the claim further. Communication [2] fluent and concise use of scientific language and representations The response is easily understood, avoids unnecessary repetition and meets the required length. Overall results The three studies used to determine whether a natural or synthetic shampoo is better at cleaning hair have not led to any conclusive results. The characteristics used to determine whether a shampoo cleans better were limited to the surface tension of the water when the shampoo was added, wetting time, foaming ability, solid content and detergency. In all three studies, the natural shampoo performed better in some characteristics, while the synthetic shampoo in other characteristics. Therefore, the review of the studies done into cleaning ability does not support or refute the claim that natural shampoos are better cleaners than synthetic shampoos. Further investigations required To truly investigate whether natural shampoos are better than synthetic shampoos in terms of surface tension, wetting time, solid content, foaming ability and detergency, further testing would need to be carried out. This testing would need to involve a larger sample of both natural and synthetic shampoos. The amount of shampoo would need to remain constant in all testing and be similar to the quantity of shampoo used when washing hair, and the hardness of the water would also need to be constant. The effect of water hardness on cleaning ability could also be investigated. Two of the studies used laboratory-formulated shampoos rather than commercially available formulations. For the results to be relevant to consumers, the shampoos investigated should be readily available. The question of whether natural shampoos are better than synthetic shampoos is not just dependent on cleaning ability. Shampoos have reportedly been linked to skin reactions. To investigate this, patch testing of a variety of shampoos, both synthetic and natural, would need to occur on a sample of population that is representative of the whole. The environmental impact of shampoo, both short and long term, would also need to be considered in evaluating the claim that natural shampoos are better than synthetic shampoos. Ultimately, the best shampoo will be the best cleaner, have the least environmental impact and not react with a user’s skin.
