Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 1 of 1 1 Course overview 1.1 Introduction 1.1.1 Rationale At the core of all science endeavour is the inquiry into the nature of the universe. Science uses a systematic way of thinking, involving creative and critical reasoning, in order to acquire better and more reliable knowledge. Scientists recognise that knowledge is not fixed, but is fallible and open to challenge. As such, scientific endeavour is never conducted in isolation, but builds on and challenges an existing body of knowledge in the pursuit of more reliable knowledge. This collaborative process, whereby new knowledge is gained, is essential to the cooperative advancement of science, technology, health and society in the 21st century. Tertiary study in any field will be aided by the transferable skills developed in this senior Science subject. It is expected that an appreciation of, and respect for, evidence-based conclusions and the processes required to gather, scrutinise and use evidence, will be carried forward into all aspects of life beyond the classroom. The purpose of senior Science subjects in Queensland is to introduce students to a scientific discipline. Students will be required to learn and apply aspects of the knowledge and skill of the discipline (thinking, experimentation, problem-solving and research skills), understand how it works and how it may impact society. Upon completion of the course, students will have an appreciation for a body of scientific knowledge and the process that is undertaken to acquire this knowledge. They will be able to distinguish between claims and evidence, opinion and fact, and conjecture and conclusions. In each of the senior Science subjects, students will develop: • a deep understanding of a core body of discipline knowledge • aspects of the skills used by scientists to develop new knowledge, as well as the opportunity to refine these skills through practical activities • the ability to coordinate their understandings of the knowledge and skills associated with the discipline to refine experiments, verify known scientific relationships, explain phenomena with justification and evaluate claims by finding evidence to support or refute the claims. Biology provides opportunities for students to engage with living systems. In Unit 1, students develop their understanding of cells and multicellular organisms. In Unit 2, they engage with the concept of maintaining the internal environment. In Unit 3, students study biodiversity and the interconnectedness of life. This knowledge is linked in Unit 4 with the concepts of heredity and the continuity of life. Students will learn valuable skills required for the scientific investigation of questions. In addition, they will become citizens who are better informed about the world around them and who have the critical skills to evaluate and make evidence-based decisions about current scientific issues. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 2 of 2 Biology aims to develop students’: • sense of wonder and curiosity about life • respect for all living things and the environment • understanding of how biological systems interact and are interrelated, the flow of matter and energy through and between these systems, and the processes by which they persist and change • understanding of major biological concepts, theories and models related to biological systems at all scales, from subcellular processes to ecosystem dynamics • appreciation of how biological knowledge has developed over time and continues to develop; how scientists use biology in a wide range of applications; and how biological knowledge influences society in local, regional and global contexts • ability to plan and carry out fieldwork, laboratory and other research investigations, including the collection and analysis of qualitative and quantitative data and the interpretation of evidence • ability to use sound, evidence-based arguments creatively and analytically when evaluating claims and applying biological knowledge • ability to communicate biological understanding, findings, arguments and conclusions using appropriate representations, modes and genres. Assumed knowledge, prior learning or experience The P–10 Australian Curriculum: Science is assumed knowledge for this syllabus. Pathways Biology is a General subject suited to students who are interested in pathways beyond school that lead to tertiary studies, vocational education or work. A course of study in Biology can establish a basis for further education and employment in the fields of medicine, forensics, veterinary, food and marine sciences, agriculture, biotechnology, environmental rehabilitation, biosecurity, quarantine, conservation and sustainability. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 3 of 3 1.1.2 Learning area structure All learning areas build on the P–10 Australian Curriculum. Figure 1: Learning area structure Applied • no more than one Applied subject can contribute to an ATAR calculation • results contribute to the QCE General • results may contribute to an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) calculation • results contribute to the Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE) • includes external assessment Agricultural Science Biology Chemistry Earth & Environmental Science Marine Science Agricultural Practices Aquatic Practices Psychology P–10 Australian Curriculum Science Senior Secondary Sciences Learning Area Science in Practice Physics Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 4 of 4 1.1.3 Course structure Biology is a course of study consisting of four units. Subject matter, learning experiences and assessment increase in complexity from Units 1 and 2 to Units 3 and 4 as students develop greater independence as learners. Units 1 and 2 provide foundational learning, which allows students to experience all syllabus objectives and begin engaging with the course subject matter. Students should complete Units 1 and 2 before beginning Units 3 and 4. Units 3 and 4 consolidate student learning. Only the results from Units 3 and 4 will contribute to ATAR calculations. Figure 2 outlines the structure of this course of study. Each unit has been developed with a notional time of 55 hours of teaching and learning, including assessment.

For reporting purposes, schools should develop at least one assessment per unit, with a maximum of four assessments across Units 1 and 2. Summative external assessment: Examination (50%) Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 5 of 5 1.2 Teaching and learning 1.2.1 Syllabus objectives The syllabus objectives outline what students have the opportunity to learn. Assessment provides evidence of how well students have achieved the objectives. Syllabus objectives inform unit objectives, which are contextualised for the subject matter and requirements of the unit. Unit objectives, in turn, inform the assessment objectives, which are further contextualised for the requirements of the assessment instruments. The number of each objective remains constant at all levels, i.e. Syllabus objective 1 relates to Unit objective 1 and to Assessment objective 1 in each assessment instrument. Syllabus objectives are described in terms of actions that operate on the subject matter. Students are required to use a range of cognitive processes in order to demonstrate and meet the syllabus objectives. These cognitive processes are described in the explanatory paragraph following each objective in terms of four levels: retrieval, comprehension, analytical processes (analysis), and knowledge utilisation, with each process building on the previous processes (see Marzano & Kendall 2007, 2008). That is, comprehension requires retrieval, and knowledge utilisation requires retrieval, comprehension and analytical processes (analysis). By the conclusion of the course of study, students will: Syllabus objective Unit 1 Unit 2 Unit 3 Unit 4 1. describe and explain scientific concepts, theories, models and systems and their limitations ● ● ● ● 2. apply understanding of scientific concepts, theories, models and systems within their limitations ● ● ● ● 3. analyse evidence ● ● ● ● 4. interpret evidence ● ● ● ● 5. investigate phenomena ● ● ● ● 6. evaluate processes, claims and conclusions ● ● ● ● 7. communicate understandings, findings, arguments and conclusions. ● ● ● ● 1. describe and explain scientific concepts, theories, models and systems and their limitations When students describe and explain scientific concepts, theories, models and systems and their limitations, they give a detailed account of a concept, theory, model or system making relationships, reasons or causes evident. They reflect on relevant social, economic, ethical and cultural factors. 2. apply understanding of scientific concepts, theories, models and systems within their limitations When students apply their understanding of scientific concepts, theories, models and systems within their limitations, they explain local, regional and global phenomena and determine outcomes, behaviours and implications. They use algebraic, visual and graphical representations of scientific relationships and data to determine unknown scientific quantities or variables. They recognise the limitations of models and theories when discussing results. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 6 of 6 3. analyse evidence When students analyse evidence, they recognise the variety of forms of evidence, and distinguish between quantitative, qualitative, primary and secondary evidence. When students analyse evidence in the form of qualitative data, they identify the essential elements, features or components of the data. When students analyse evidence in the form of quantitative data, they use mathematical processes to identify trends, patterns, relationships, limitations and uncertainty in the data. 4. interpret evidence When students interpret evidence, they use their knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts, theories, models and systems and their limitations to draw conclusions based on their analysis of qualitative and quantitative evidence and established criteria. 5. investigate phenomena When students investigate phenomena, they plan and carry out experimental and/or research activities in order to obtain evidence for the purpose of reaching a conclusion. They collect, collate and process evidence. Students ensure that relevant ethical, environmental and safety considerations have been incorporated into their practice. 6. evaluate processes, claims and conclusions When students evaluate processes, claims and conclusions, they critically reflect on the available evidence and make judgments about its application to a research question, and its use to inform further investigation. When students evaluate processes, they use the quality of the evidence to evaluate the validity and reliability of the method used, the appropriateness of assumptions made and possible refinements required. When students evaluate claims, they identify the evidence that would be required to support or refute the claim. They scrutinise evidence for bias, conjecture, alternatives or inaccuracies. When students evaluate conclusions, they consider the credibility of the supporting evidence. 7. communicate understandings, findings, arguments and conclusions When students communicate, they use scientific representations and language within appropriate genres to present information. They use technology to share knowledge by exchanging information and creating information products. 1.2.2 Underpinning factors There are three skill sets that underpin senior syllabuses and are essential for defining the distinctive nature of subjects: • literacy — the set of knowledge and skills about language and texts essential for understanding and conveying Biology content • numeracy — the knowledge, skills, behaviours and dispositions that students need to use mathematics in a wide range of situations, to recognise and understand the role of mathematics in the world, and to develop the dispositions and capacities to use mathematical knowledge and skills purposefully • 21st century skills — the attributes and skills students need to prepare them for higher education, work and engagement in a complex and rapidly changing world. These skill sets, which overlap and interact, are derived from current education, industry and community expectations. They encompass the knowledge, skills, capabilities, behaviours and dispositions that will help students live and work successfully in the 21st century. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 7 of 7 Together these three skill sets shape the development of senior subject syllabuses. Although coverage of each skill set may vary from syllabus to syllabus, students should be provided with opportunities to learn through and about these skills over the course of study. Each skill set contains identifiable knowledge and skills that can be directly assessed. Literacy in Biology The skills of literacy in science (distinct from ‘scientific literacy’) are essential for successful scientific inquiry (Douglas et al 2006, Saul 2004, Yore et al 2003). In any scientific inquiry activity, literacy skills support students by enabling them to grapple with ideas, conduct research, discuss their thoughts, enhance conceptual understanding and solve problems (Krajcik & Southerland 2010). The literacy skills important to this subject are those related to the comprehension and composition of texts that provide information, describe and explain events and phenomena, report on experiments, present and analyse data, and offer opinions or claims (ACARA 2015a). Biology students comprehend and compose multimedia texts, such as reports, charts, graphs, diagrams, pictures, maps, animations, models and other visual media. They understand and apply language structures that are used to link information and ideas, give descriptions and explanations, formulate research questions and construct evidence-based arguments capable of expressing an informed position (ACARA 2015a). Students learn these skills by having opportunity to engage with: • rich and varied science and media texts • class activities that use literacy as a tool for learning • strategies for reading scientific texts (Moore 2009). The learning opportunities described above can be integrated with stimulus questions, Science as a Human Endeavour subject matter and mandatory practicals. Students could be asked to: • explain links between new ideas and prior knowledge and experiences • engage in learning experiences directed by a question that is meaningful to their lives • connect multiple representations of a concept (e.g. written texts, formulas, graphs or diagrams of the same concept) • use scientific ideas to compose evidence-based conclusions in the mandatory practicals • engage with the discourses of science such as those found in scientific literature and media texts (Krajcik & Southerland 2010). These strategies will promote students’ ability to read, write and communicate about science so that they can engage with science-related issues throughout their lives. These aspects of literacy knowledge and skills are embedded in the syllabus objectives, unit objectives and subject matter, and instrument-specific marking guides (ISMGs) for Biology. Numeracy in Biology The skills of numeracy in Biology are essential for successful scientific inquiry. In any scientific inquiry activity, numeracy skills support students by enabling them to make and record observations; order, represent and analyse data; and interpret trends and relationships (ACARA 2015b). Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 8 of 8 The numeracy skills important to this subject are those related to the interpretation of complex spatial and graphical representations, and the appreciation of the ways in which scientific concepts, theories, systems and models are structured, communicated, interact or change across spatial and temporal scales (ACARA 2015b). Students will use knowledge and skills in areas such as: • graphing • ratio and proportion • converting from one unit to another • scientific notation • an understanding of place in number (significant figures) • estimation and calculation in order to analyse data • determining the reliability of data • interpreting and manipulating mathematical relationships in order to calculate and predict values (ACARA 2009, 2015). Students will learn these skills as they: • measure and record data during the mandatory practicals • use or interpret meaning from formulas • interpret graphical information presented in science and media texts • undertake class activities that use numeracy as a tool for learning • use mathematics or equations as justification or evidence for conclusions • interpret and represent information in a variety of forms. These aspects of literacy knowledge and skills are embedded in the syllabus objectives, unit objectives and subject matter, and ISMGs for Biology. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 9 of 9 21st century skills The 21st century skills identified in the following table reflect a common agreement, both in Australia and internationally, on the skills and attributes students need to prepare them for higher education, work and engagement in a complex and rapidly changing world. 21st century skills Associated skills 21st century skills Associated skills critical thinking • analytical thinking • problem-solving • decision-making • reasoning • reflecting and evaluating • intellectual flexibility creative thinking • innovation • initiative and enterprise • curiosity and imagination • creativity • generating and applying new ideas • identifying alternatives • seeing or making new links communication • effective oral and written communication • using language, symbols and texts • communicating ideas effectively with diverse audiences collaboration and teamwork • relating to others (interacting with others) • recognising and using diverse perspectives • participating and contributing • community connections personal and social skills • adaptability/flexibility • management (self, career, time, planning and organising) • character (resilience, mindfulness, open- and fair-mindedness, self- awareness) • leadership • citizenship • cultural awareness • ethical (and moral) understanding Information & communication technologies (ICT) skills • operations and concepts • accessing and analysing information • being productive users of technology • digital citizenship (being safe, positive and responsible online) Biology helps develop the following 21st century skills: • critical thinking • creative thinking • communication • collaboration and teamwork • personal and social skills • information & communication technologies (ICT) skills. These elements of 21st century skills are embedded in the syllabus objectives, unit objectives and subject matter, and ISMGs for Biology. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 10 of 10 1.2.3 Aboriginal perspectives and Torres Strait Islander perspectives The QCAA is committed to reconciliation in Australia. As part of its commitment, the QCAA affirms that: • Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the first Australians, and have the oldest living cultures in human history • Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples have strong cultural traditions and speak diverse languages and dialects, other than Standard Australian English • teaching and learning in Queensland schools should provide opportunities for students to deepen their knowledge of Australia by engaging with the perspectives of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples • positive outcomes for Aboriginal students and Torres Strait Islander students are supported by successfully embedding Aboriginal perspectives and Torres Strait Islander perspectives across planning, teaching and assessing student achievement. Guidelines about Aboriginal perspectives and Torres Strait Islander perspectives and resources for teaching are available at www.qcaa.qld.edu.au/k-12-policies/aboriginal-torres-strait-islander- perspectives. Where appropriate, Aboriginal perspectives and Torres Strait Islander perspectives have been embedded in the subject matter. 1.2.4 Pedagogical and conceptual frameworks Defining inquiry in science education In order to support the school’s task of aligning their chosen pedagogical framework with the curriculum and assessment expectations outlined in this syllabus, some guidance has been provided in the form of clarification of the use of the term inquiry and the articulation of a framework to describe the process of inquiry. The purpose of this guidance is to prevent misunderstandings and problematic conflations and their subsequent negative impact on student learning. As Abrams, Southerland and Silva (2008, p. xv) stated in their book, Inquiry in the Classroom: Realities and opportunities: Inquiry in the classroom can be conceived as a complex set of ideas, beliefs, skills, and/or pedagogies. It is evident that attempting to select a singular definition of inquiry may be an insurmountable and fruitless task. Any single definition of inquiry in the classroom would necessarily reflect the thinking of a particular school of thought, at a particular moment in time, or a particular goal, and such a singular definition may serve to limit legitimate and necessary components of science learning. However, operating without a firm understanding of the various forms of inquiry leaves science educators often ‘talking past’ one another, and often results in very muddled attempts in the classroom. Uses of the term inquiry Common phrases involving the term inquiry have been listed below: • science inquiry • science inquiry skills • the inquiry process • inquiry-based learning. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 11 of 11 This syllabus refers to the first three uses listed above. The first, science inquiry, defines the practical work of a scientist (Harlen 2013). The second, science inquiry skills, refers to the skills required to do the work of a scientist (Harlen 2013). The third, the inquiry process, is a framework that can be used to describe the process of asking a question and then answering it. The final phrase, inquiry-based learning, refers to a variety of teaching and learning strategies an educator may choose to use within their school’s pedagogical framework. Although a school may choose to adopt an inquiry-based pedagogy, this syllabus is not intended to endorse or recommend an inquiry-based learning approach. Science inquiry and science inquiry skills Science inquiry involves identifying and posing questions and working to answer them. It is concerned with evaluating claims, investigating ideas, solving problems, reasoning, drawing valid conclusions and developing evidence-based arguments. It can easily be summarised as the ‘work of a scientist’ (Hackling 2005). Within this syllabus, it is expected that students will engage in aspects of the work of a scientist by engaging in science inquiry (Tytler 2007). This expectation can be seen, for example, in the inclusion of the mandatory practicals, student experiment and research investigation. Science inquiry skills are the skills required to do the work of a scientist. They include writing research questions, planning, conducting, recording information and reflecting on investigations; processing, analysing and interpreting evidence; evaluating conclusions, processes and claims; and communicating findings (ACARA 2015). It is expected that students are taught science inquiry skills (Krajcik et al 2000). The syllabus outlines a number of these skills in the subject matter. Some science inquiry skills will be used to complete the mandatory and suggested practicals. The selection, application and coordination of science inquiry skills will be required in the student experiment and research investigation. It is the prerogative of the educator to decide how the science inquiry skills are to be developed. For example, teachers will determine how mandatory practicals are used as opportunities to: • develop, rehearse and refine science inquiry skills • engage students in scaffolded or open-ended science inquiry tasks • formatively assess science inquiry skills. Framework to describe the inquiry process In order to support student engagement in activities involving inquiry, it is useful to establish a common language or framework to distinguish between stages of the process. The stages involved in any inquiry are: • forming and describing the inquiry activity • finding valid and reliable evidence for the inquiry activity • analysing and interpreting the evidence selected • evaluating the conclusions, processes or claims. This framework uses reflection as the connection between, and driver of, all the stages. The progression through the inquiry process requires reflection on the decisions made and any new information that has emerged during the process to inform the next stage. Each stage of the inquiry process is worthy of reflection, the result of which may be the revision of previous stages (Marzano & Kendall 2007). Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 12 of 12 Figure 3: Stages of inquiry process Safety and ethics Workplace health and safety Biology is designed to expose students to the practical components of science through practical experiences in the laboratory and the field. These experiences expose students to a variety of hazards, from biological and poisonous substances to injury from equipment. Besides a teacher’s duty of care that derives from the Education (General Provisions) Act 2006, there are other legislative and regulatory requirements, for example the Work Health and Safety Act 2011, that will influence the nature and extent of practical work. All practical work must be organised with student safety in mind. The Department of Education and Training (DET) Policy and Procedure Register (http://ppr.det.qld.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx) provides guidance about current science safety protocols. It is the responsibility of all schools to ensure that their practices meet current legislation requirements. References to relevant legislation and regulations are supported by the Reference list located on the Biology subject page of the QCAA website. Care and use of animals for scientific purposes Governing principles The QCAA recognises that school personnel involved in the care and use of animals for scientific purposes have legal obligations under the Animal Care and Protection Act 2001 (the Act). Queensland schools intending to use animals for scientific purposes must apply for and receive animal ethics approval from the Queensland Schools Animals Ethics Committee (QSAEC) prior to conducting these activities. The purpose of the Act is to promote the responsible care and use of animals, provide standards for the care and use of animals, protect animals from unjustifiable, unnecessary or unreasonable pain, and ensure that the use of animals for scientific purposes is accountable, open and responsible. The Act also requires mandatory compliance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes 2013 (8th edition), available from the National Health and Medical Research Council’s publications website Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 13 of 13 It should also be recognised that school personnel and students are not carrying out essential, groundbreaking research and, thus, standards in schools should be more stringent than those used in universities and research and development organisations. Separate to the Act and ethical approval, teachers best practice includes referring to the 3Rs principle of animal welfare: • replacement — any investigations involving animals should initially consider replacing the animals with cells, plants or computer simulations • refinement — refinement of the investigation should aim to alleviate any harm or distress to the animals used • reduction — reduce the number of animals used. Respect for animals must underpin all decisions and actions involving the care and use of animals. The responsibilities associated with this obligation apply throughout the animal’s lifetime, including acquisition, transport, breeding, housing, husbandry and the use of animals in a project. Experiments that require the endpoint as the death of any animal, e.g. LD50, are unacceptable. Animal dissections There is no requirement for students to witness or carry out a dissection of any animal, invertebrate or vertebrate in this course. If animal dissections are chosen by the teacher as an important educational experience, the 3Rs principle of animal welfare should be applied (i.e. replacement, refinement and reduction — see above for more information). Teachers should always discuss the purpose of the dissection and allow any student, without requirement for explanation, to opt out if they wish. Teachers should be respectful of the variety of reasons students may have for choosing not to participate. Experimental studies using humans If teaching and learning activities include experimental investigations using human subjects, teachers and schools have a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that students follow ethical principles at all times. Best practice includes: • protection from harm — any investigations that create harm, distress or discomfort for participants are not permitted. This includes investigations involving ingestion (e.g. food, drink, smoking or drugs) and deprivation (e.g. sleep, food) • gaining informed consent — any experiments involving humans must be with their written permission. Students under the age of 16 should have written permission from a parent or guardian. All participants should be above the age of 12 and of sound mind. The process of being informed requires that participants understand the purpose of the investigation and that they can withdraw from the process at any stage • ensuring confidentiality and anonymity — all data collected must be kept in a confidential and responsible manner and not divulged to any other person. Anonymity for each participant must be guaranteed. Teachers should refer to the following for detailed advice: • the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007), issued by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in accordance with the NHMRC Act 1992 (Cwlth) • the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000 (Cwlth) • the Code of Ethics of the Australian Psychological Society (APS). Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 14 of 14 1.2.5 Subject matter Subject matter is the body of information, mental procedures and psychomotor procedures (see Marzano & Kendall 2007, 2008) that are necessary for students’ learning and engagement with Biology. It is particular to each unit in the course of study and provides the basis for student learning experiences. Subject matter has a direct relationship to the unit objectives, but is of a finer granularity and is more specific. These statements of learning are constructed in a similar way to objectives. Each statement: • describes an action (or combination of actions) — what the student is expected to do • describes the element — expressed as information, mental procedures and/or psychomotor procedures • is contextualised for the topic or circumstance particular to the unit. Organisation of subject matter The subject matter is organised as topics within each unit. The subject matter indicates the required knowledge and skills that students must acquire. Students should experience the mandatory practicals. It is expected that approximately five hours will be required to complete the mandatory practicals that involve fieldwork. The subject matter from Units 3 and 4 will be assessed by the external examination. Science as a Human Endeavour Each Queensland senior science subject requires students to learn and apply aspects of the knowledge and skill of the discipline. It is recognised that students should also develop an appreciation for the nature and development of science, and its use and influence on society. While this appreciation will not be assessed, the syllabus provides guidance as to where it may be developed. Importantly, this guidance draws students’ attention to the way in which science operates, both in relation to the development of understanding and explanations about the world and to its influence on society. Students should become familiar with the following Science as a Human Endeavour (SHE) concepts: • Science is a global enterprise that relies on clear communication, international conventions, peer review and reproducibility. • Development of complex models and/or theories often requires a wide range of evidence from multiple individuals and across disciplines. • Advances in science understanding in one field can influence other areas of science, technology and engineering. • The use and acceptance of scientific knowledge is influenced by social, economic, cultural and ethical contexts. • The use of scientific knowledge may have beneficial and/or harmful and/or unintended consequences. • Scientific knowledge can enable scientists to offer valid explanations and make reliable predictions. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 15 of 15 • Scientific knowledge can be used to develop and evaluate projected economic, social and environmental impacts and to design action for sustainability. • ICT and other technologies have dramatically increased the size, accuracy and geographic and temporal scope of datasets with which scientists work. • Models and theories are contested and refined or replaced when new evidence challenges them, or when a new model or theory has greater explanatory power. • Scientific knowledge can be used to inform the monitoring, assessment and evaluation of risk. • Science can be limited in its ability to provide definitive answers to public debate; there may be insufficient reliable data available, or interpretation of the data may be open to question. • International collaboration is often required when investing in large-scale science projects or addressing issues for the Asia–Pacific region. To support the development of these concepts, this syllabus identifies SHE guidance in each topic. This highlights opportunities for teachers to contextualise the associated subject matter and provides stimulus for the development of claims and research questions for investigation. Additional opportunities include: • the mandatory and suggested practicals provide opportunity for students to witness the nature of science • the student experiment provides opportunity for students to experience how the development of new science knowledge is built upon existing knowledge • the research investigation provides opportunity for students to appreciate the use and influence of scientific evidence to make decisions or to contribute to public debate about a claim. Finally, the SHE statements at the end of each topic may be used to support the development and interrogation of claims, and be useful as a starting point for the research investigation. Guidance The guidance included with each topic is designed to clarify the scope of the subject matter and identify opportunities to integrate science inquiry skills and SHE strands into the subject matter. A number of tags are used to highlight aspects of the guidance: • Notional time: the depth of subject matter coverage is indicated by the amount of time needed to cover this subject matter in the sequence presented in the syllabus. • Formula: defines a formula described in the subject matter. • SHE: identifies an opportunity to integrate an aspect of the Science as a Human Endeavour strand and may also be used as a starting point for a research investigation. • Suggested practical: identifies an opportunity for inquiry skills to be developed and may be used as a starting point for a student experiment. • Manipulative skill: identifies skills that need to be developed in order for students to complete suggested or mandatory practicals. • Syllabus links: identifies links between syllabus units. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 16 of 16 1.3 Assessment — general information Assessments are formative in Units 1 and 2, and summative in Units 3 and 4. Assessment Unit 1 Unit 2 Unit 3 Unit 4 Formative assessments ● ● Summative internal assessment 1 ● Summative internal assessment 2 ● Summative internal assessment 3 ● Summative external assessment ● ● 1.3.1 Formative assessments — Units 1 and 2 Formative assessments provide feedback to both students and teachers about each student’s progress in the course of study. Schools develop internal assessments for each senior subject, based on the learning described in Units 1 and 2 of the subject syllabus. Each unit objective must be assessed at least once. For reporting purposes, schools should devise at least two but no more than four assessments for Units 1 and 2 of this subject. At least one assessment must be completed for each unit. The sequencing, scope and scale of assessments for Units 1 and 2 are matters for each school to decide and should reflect the local context. Teachers are encouraged to use the A–E descriptors in the reporting standards (Section 1.5) to provide formative feedback to students and to report on progress. 1.3.2 Summative assessments — Units 3 and 4 Students will complete a total of four summative assessments — three internal and one external — that count towards their final mark in each subject. Schools develop three internal assessments for each senior subject, based on the learning described in Units 3 and 4 of the syllabus. The three summative internal assessments will be endorsed and the results confirmed by the QCAA. These results will be combined with a single external assessment developed and marked by the QCAA. The external assessment results for Biology will contribute 50% towards a student’s result. Summative internal assessment — instrument-specific marking guides This syllabus provides ISMGs for the three summative internal assessments in Units 3 and 4. The ISMGs describe the characteristics evident in student responses and align with the identified assessment objectives. Assessment objectives are drawn from the unit objectives and are contextualised for the requirements of the assessment instrument. Criteria Each ISMG groups assessment objectives into criteria. An assessment objective may appear in multiple criteria, or in a single criterion of an assessment. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 17 of 17 Making judgments Assessment evidence of student performance in each criterion is matched to a performance-level descriptor, which describes the typical characteristics of student work. Where a student response has characteristics from more than one performance level, a best-fit approach is used. Where a performance level has a two-mark range, it must be decided if the best fit is the higher or lower mark of the range. Authentication Schools and teachers must have strategies in place for ensuring that work submitted for internal summative assessment is the student’s own. Authentication strategies outlined in QCAA guidelines, which include guidance for drafting, scaffolding and teacher feedback, must be adhered to. Summative external assessment The summative external assessment adds valuable evidence of achievement to a student’s profile. External assessment is: • common to all schools • administered under the same conditions at the same time and on the same day • developed and marked by the QCAA according to a commonly applied marking scheme. The external assessment contributes 50% to the student’s result in Biology. It is not privileged over the school-based assessment. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 18 of 18 1.4 Reporting standards Reporting standards are summary statements that succinctly describe typical performance at each of the five levels (A–E). They reflect the cognitive taxonomy and objectives of the course of study. The primary purpose of reporting standards is for twice-yearly reporting on student progress. These descriptors can also be used to help teachers provide formative feedback to students and to align ISMGs.

An understanding of the structure and function of cells is essential to appreciate the processes vital for survival. Students investigate the structure and function of cells and multicellular organisms. They examine the structure and function of plant and animal systems at cell and tissue levels in order to analyse how they facilitate the efficient provision or removal of materials. Contexts that could be investigated in this unit include stem cell research, animal ethics, organ and tissue transplantation, bio-artificial organs and photosynthesis productivity. Through the investigation of these contexts, students may explore the ethical considerations that apply to the use of living organisms in research. Participation in a range of experiments and investigations will allow students to progressively develop their suite of science inquiry skills while gaining an enhanced appreciation of the relationship between structure and function of cells and multicellular organisms. Collaborative experimental work also helps students to develop communication, interaction, character and management skills. Throughout the unit, students develop skills in conducting real or virtual laboratory work and carrying out microscopic examination of cells and tissues. They use these skills to construct and use models to describe and interpret data about the functions of cells and organisms and to explain cellular processes. 2.2 Unit objectives Unit objectives are drawn from the syllabus objectives and are contextualised for the subject matter and requirements of the unit.

An understanding of personal and communal responses is essential to appreciate personal lifestyle choices and community health. Students develop scientific skills and conceptual understanding in homeostasis, the immune system and the relationships between global, community and individual immunity. They examine geographical and population data to analyse strategies that may have personal and communal consequences. Contexts that could be investigated in this unit include historical and current epidemics and pandemics. Through the investigation of these contexts, students may explore immunisation, quarantine, management strategies and travel preparation (both local and international). Participation in a range of experiments and investigations will allow students to progressively develop their suite of science inquiry skills while gaining an enhanced appreciation of controlling the internal environment. Collaborative experimental work also helps students to develop communication, interaction, character and management skills. Throughout the unit, students develop skills in the application of technology, scientific practicals and investigations, analysis and evaluation. These skills allow them to describe and explain relationships between external and internal stimuli on controlling the internal environment. 3.2 Unit objectives Unit objectives are drawn from the syllabus objectives and are contextualised for the subject matter and requirements of the unit.

Science as a Human Endeavour (SHE) • SHE subject matter will not be assessed on the external examination but could be used in the development of claims and research questions for a research investigation. • Modelling disease outbreak and spread: Mass vaccination programs are more successful when informed by disease outbreak models. • Managing pandemics in the Asia region: Asia has been described as being more susceptible to epidemics and pandemics of infectious diseases due to increasing migration and global travel, high population density in urban areas and underdeveloped healthcare systems in some countries. The high cost of drugs and vaccines presents a particular challenge for developing countries in Asia, as does community mistrust of vaccination. • Quarantine and biosecurity: As global trade and air travel become more prevalent, it is increasingly important for Australia to protect its agriculture, industry and environment through quarantine measures. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 34 of 34 3.5 Assessment guidance In constructing assessment instruments for Unit 2, schools should ensure that the objectives cover, or are chosen from, the unit objectives. If one assessment instrument is developed for a unit, it must assess all the unit objectives; if more than one assessment instrument is developed, the unit objectives must be covered across those instruments. It is suggested that student performance on Unit 2 is assessed using techniques modelled on the techniques used in Unit 4: • a research investigation • an examination that includes some items modelled on the data test. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 35 of 35 4 Unit 3: Biodiversity and the interconnectedness of life 4.1 Unit description In Unit 3, students explore the ways biology is used to describe and explain: the biodiversity within ecosystems; a range of biotic and abiotic components; species interactions; adaptations of organisms to their environment; principles of population dynamics; and how classification systems are used to identify organisms and aid scientific communication. An understanding of the structure of ecosystems, the processes involved in the movement of energy and matter in ecosystems and how environmental factors limit populations is essential to appreciate the dynamics, diversity and underlying unity of these systems. Students investigate the interactions within and between species, and the interactions between abiotic and biotic components of ecosystems. They also investigate how measurements of abiotic factors, population numbers, species diversity and descriptions of interactions between species can form the basis for spatial and temporal comparisons between ecosystems. They examine and analyse data collected from fieldwork to understand the interconnectedness of organisms, the physical environment and the impact of human activity. Contexts that could be investigated in this unit include: the local ecosystem; fishing and mining industries; habitat destruction; and ecosystem management systems. Through investigating these contexts, students may explore the impact of human activity on biodiversity, and sustainability of practices. Participation in a range of experiments and investigations will allow students to progressively develop their suite of science inquiry skills while gaining an enhanced appreciation of how scientific knowledge is used to offer valid explanations and reliable predictions, and the ways in which scientific knowledge interacts with social, economic, cultural and ethical factors. Collaborative experimental work also helps students to develop communication, interaction, character and management skills. Throughout the unit, students develop skills in sampling ecological systems, organising and analysing data and developing ecological models to describe and explain the diversity and interconnectedness of life on Earth.

In Biology it contributes 50% to a student’s overall subject result. Summative external assessment assesses learning from both Units 3 and 4. The external assessment in Biology is common to all schools and administered under the same conditions, at the same time, on the same day. See Section 5.5.2. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 53 of 53 5 Unit 4: Heredity and continuity of life 5.1 Unit description In Unit 4, students explore the ways biology is used to describe and explain the cellular processes and mechanisms that ensure the continuity of life. An understanding of the processes and mechanisms of how life on Earth has persisted, changed and diversified over the last 3.5 billion years is essential to appreciate the unity and diversity of life. Students investigate different factors that affect cellular processes and gene pools. They examine different patterns of inheritance and the genetic basis of the theory of evolution through natural selection to analyse the use of predictive models in decision-making. Contexts that could be investigated in this unit include DNA profiling, gene therapy and genetically modified organisms. Through the investigation of these contexts, students may explore the impact of the development of these technologies on future society. Participation in a range of experiments and investigations will allow students to progressively develop their suite of science inquiry skills while gaining an enhanced appreciation of patterns of inheritance and the effect of a variety of factors on gene pools. Collaborative experimental work also helps students to develop communication, interaction, character and management skills. Throughout the unit, students develop skills in modelling processes to describe and explain inheritance and population genetics. 5.2 Unit objectives Unit objectives are drawn from the syllabus objectives and are contextualised for the subject matter and requirements of the unit. Each unit objective must be assessed at least once.

Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 55 of 55 Subject matter Guidance Gene expression • define the terms genome and gene • understand that genes include ‘coding’ (exons) and ‘noncoding’ DNA (which includes a variety of transcribed proteins: functional RNA (i.e. tRNA), centromeres, telomeres and introns. Recognise that many functions of ‘noncoding’ DNA are yet to be determined) • explain the process of protein synthesis in terms of ­ transcription of a gene into messenger RNA in the nucleus ­ translation of mRNA into an amino acid sequence at the ribosome (refer to transfer RNA, codons and anticodons) • recognise that the purpose of gene expression is to synthesise a functional gene product (protein or functional RNA); that the process can be regulated and is used by all known life • identify that there are factors that regulate the phenotypic expression of genes ­ during transcription and translation (proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences) ­ through the products of other genes ­ via environmental exposure (consider the twin methodology in epigenetic studies) • recognise that differential gene expression, controlled by transcription factors, regulates cell differentiation for tissue formation and morphology • recall an example of a transcription factor gene that regulates morphology (HOX transcription factor family) and cell differentiation (sex-determining region Y). • Notional time: 6 hours • Refer to glossary for definitions of genome and gene. • The term junk DNA is misleading and should not be used in reference to ‘noncoding’ DNA. • When identifying transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression, reference to operators, promoters, regulators, enhancers, silencers, insulators, TATA boxes, polyadenylation and DNA methylation is not required. • Students should recognise gene expression in the context of an example. They are not required to explain or describe the mechanisms of this process. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 56 of 56 Subject matter Guidance Mutations • identify how mutations in genes and chromosomes can result from errors in ­ DNA replication (point and frameshift mutation) ­ cell division (non-disjunction) ­ damage by mutagens (physical, including UV radiation, ionising radiation and heat and chemical) • explain how non-disjunction leads to aneuploidy • use a human karyotype to identify ploidy changes and predict a genetic disorder from given data • describe how inherited mutations can alter the variations in the genotype of offspring. • Notional time: 3 hours • Students are not required to identify the effects of mutations (i.e. silent, missense, nonsense). • Recall of specific chemical mutagens is not required. Rather, an understanding should be developed that a large number of chemical mutagens are carcinogenic and interact directly with DNA. • Examples of aneuploidy could include trisomy 21. Inheritance • predict frequencies of genotypes and phenotypes using data from probability models (including frequency histograms and Punnett squares) and by taking into consideration patterns of inheritance for the following types of alleles: autosomal dominant, sex linked and multiple • define polygenic inheritance and predict frequencies of genotypes and phenotypes for using three of the possible alleles. • Notional time: 3 hours • Refer to the glossary for a definition of polygenic inheritance. • Multiple allele inheritance refers to situations where there are more than two alleles considered, i.e. incomplete and co-dominance situations. • Examples for patterns of inheritance could include haemophilia (sex linked) and ABO blood types (multiple), grain colour in wheat (polygenic).

Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 58 of 58 5.4 Topic 2: Continuity of life on Earth In this topic, students will: Subject matter Guidance Evolution • define the terms evolution, microevolution and macroevolution • determine episodes of evolutionary radiation and mass extinctions from an evolutionary timescale of life on Earth (approximately 3.5 billion years) • interpret data (i.e. degree of DNA similarity) to reveal phylogenetic relationships with an understanding that comparative genomics involves the comparison of genomic features to provide evidence for the theory of evolution. • Notional time: 3 hours • Refer to the glossary for definitions of evolution, microevolution and macroevolution. • Evolutionary radiation refers to an increase in taxonomic diversity or morphological disparity. Natural selection and microevolution • recognise natural selection occurs when the pressures of environmental selection confer a selective advantage on a specific phenotype to enhance its survival (viability) and reproduction (fecundity) • identify that the selection of allele frequency in a gene pool can be positive or negative • interpret data and describe the three main types of phenotypic selection: stabilising, directional and disruptive • explain microevolutionary change through the main processes of mutation, gene flow and genetic drift. • Mandatory practical: Analyse genotypic changes for a selective pressure in a gene pool (modelling can be based on laboratory work or computer simulation). • Notional time: 6 hours • Examples of natural selection could include beak size in the Galapagos finches, antibiotic resistance or insecticide resistance. • Recognise that mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation, as it introduces new alleles to a population (syllabus link to Unit 4, Topic 1). Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 59 of 59 Subject matter Guidance Speciation and macroevolution • recall that speciation and macroevolutionary changes result from an accumulation of microevolutionary changes over time • identify that diversification between species can follow one of four patterns: divergent, convergent, parallel and coevolution • describe the modes of speciation: allopatric, sympatric, parapatric • understand that the different mechanisms of isolation — geographic (including environmental disasters, habitat fragmentation), reproductive, spatial, and temporal — influence gene flow • explain how populations with reduced genetic diversity (i.e. those affected by population bottlenecks) face an increased risk of extinction • interpret gene flow and allele frequency data from different populations in order to determine speciation. • Notional time: 6 hours. • Habitat fragmentation should be referred to in terms of natural and human causes. • Populations with reduced genetic diversity should be linked to subject matter in Unit 3. • Students should be able to determine the modes of speciation from interpretation of data. Science as a Human Endeavour (SHE) • SHE subject matter will not be assessed on the external examination but could be used in the development of claims and research questions for the research investigation. • Evidence for evolution: Technological developments in the fields of comparative genomics, comparative biochemistry and bioinformatics enable identification of further evidence for evolutionary relationships. • Human evolution — are we still evolving? Human evolution is still occurring (particularly in Western societies) after the significant cultural events of the Industrial Revolution and the introduction of agriculture, modern medicine and mass transportation. • Unsustainable population size and reserve area: Calculating minimum reserve sizes for a target conservation species should consider the viability of a single large reserve vs. a number of smaller reserves that are connected by ‘green corridors’. Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 60 of 60 5.5 Assessment 5.5.1 Summative internal assessment 3 (IA3): Research investigation (20%) Description This assessment requires students to evaluate a claim. They will do this by researching, analysing and interpreting secondary evidence from scientific texts to form the basis for a justified conclusion about the claim. A research investigation uses research practices to assess a range of cognitions in a particular context. Research practices include locating and using information beyond students’ own knowledge and the data they have been given. Research conventions must be adhered to. This assessment occurs over an extended and defined period of time. Students may use class time and their own time to develop a response. Assessment objectives This assessment technique is used to determine student achievement in the following objectives: 2. apply understanding of DNA, genes and the continuity of life or the continuity of life on Earth to develop research questions 3. analyse research evidence about DNA, genes and the continuity of life or the continuity of life on Earth 4. interpret research evidence about DNA, genes and the continuity of life or the continuity of life on Earth 5. investigate phenomena associated with DNA, genes and the continuity of life or the continuity of life on Earth through research 6. evaluate research processes, claims and conclusions about DNA, genes and the continuity of life or the continuity of life on Earth 7. communicate understandings and research findings, arguments and conclusions about DNA, genes and the continuity of life or the continuity of life on Earth. Note: Objective 1 is not assessed in this instrument. Specifications Description In the research investigation, students gather secondary evidence related to a research question in order to evaluate the claim. The students develop their research question based on a number of possible claims provided by their teacher. Students work individually throughout this task. Evidence must be obtained by researching scientifically credible sources, such as scientific journals, books by well-credentialed scientists and websites of governments, universities, independent research bodies or science and technology manufacturers. In order to complete the assessment task, students must: • select a claim to be evaluated • identify the relevant scientific concepts associated with the claim • pose a research question addressing an aspect of the claim Biology 2019 v1.3 General Senior Syllabus Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority July 2022 Page 61 of 61 • conduct research to gather scientific evidence that may be used to address the research question and subsequently evaluate the claim • analyse the data to identify sufficient and relevant evidence • identify the trends, patterns or relationships in the evidence • analyse the evidence to identify limitations • interpret the evidence to construct justified scientific arguments • interpret the evidence to form a justified conclusion to the research question • discuss the quality of the evidence • evaluate the claim by extrapolating the findings of the research question to the claim • suggest improvements and extensions to the investigation • communicate findings in an appropriate scientific genre (e.g. report, journal article, essay, conference presentation). Scientific inquiry is a non-linear, iterative process. Students will not necessarily complete these steps in the stated order; some steps may be repeated or revisited. Conditions • Time: 10 hours class time. This time will not necessarily be sequential. Students must perform the majority of the task during class time, including ­ performing background research ­ developing the research question ­ collecting scientific evidence ­ analysing and interpreting evidence and evaluating the claim ­ preparing and presenting the response (e.g. writing the scientific essay). • Length: ­ written (e.g.scientific essay), 1500–2000 words or ­ multimodal presentation (e.g. scientific conference presentation), 9–11 minutes. • Other: ­ students are to work individually throughout this task ­ the response must be presented using an appropriate scientific genre (e.g. report, journal article, essay, conference presentation) and contain  a claim  a research question  a rationale for the investigation  justified scientific arguments using evidence  a conclusion to the research question based on the interpretation of the evidence  evaluation of the claim and suggestions of improvements and extensions to the investigation  a reference list.
