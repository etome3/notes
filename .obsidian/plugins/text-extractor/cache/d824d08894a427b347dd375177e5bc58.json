Literature 2019 v1.4 IA2 high-level annotated sample response Queensland Curriculum & Assessment Authority June 2021 Page 6 of 9 Task Context In this unit, you have examined the relationship with language, culture and representations of identity in the play Constellations by Nick Payne as well as live performances and digital stories You have also explored the ways in which perspectives can be reinterpreted by experimenting with aesthetic features and stylistic devices. Task Create a monologue or digital story that reinterprets Constellations for an Australian context, to prompt emotional and critical responses in an audience familiar with the play and the new context. To complete this task, you must: • select a scene/s and aspects from the text to reinterpret in your imaginative script (e.g. perspectives of characters and/or representations of concepts, identities, times and places in the base text) • choose a cultural context within Australia through which to reimagine perspectives and/or representations from the base text • select a genre from your presentation form the options provided • invite the audience to question or reflect on the dominant cultural assumptions, attitudes, values and beliefs that underpin the play and/or the new cultural context.

Roland believes that he and Marianne could potentially become something in the future, but Marianne has other ideas with issues of her own she is handling. The humid breeze stroked his cheeks, pushing back loose strands of hair to expose his face to conditions he knew his English skin could not handle. The back of his thighs stung as they cooked on the metal bench. Eyes locked on the pavement between his double knotted shoes, a bead of sweat made a break for it, falling in a small droplet, colouring a minor fragment of the concrete. He observed the way the ants altered their trail, tracing around the droplet. Avoidance was something Roland was familiar with. Like routine, the ants followed their path, meeting for fractions of a second as if to chat. He chuckled. If only he had the ability to initiate conversation with such ease. The loudspeakers crackled to attention as heads turned in the direction of the bodiless woman’s voice. Her Australian accent, in his opinion, hindered her attempts at a passive tone. ‘The Ghan is now approaching Adelaide Parklands Terminal, please stand clear.’ The sound of metal against metal drowned out Roland’s surroundings. Sweaty piece of paper in hand, he made his way to the man dressed in uniform. Through the wave of moving heads, one woman’s long golden-brown ponytail caught his attention. To and fro her hair swung, reflecting light and hypnotising Roland like a fortune teller’s swaying clock. The vision of her disappearing through the red train’s doors left Roland with a newfound buzz. Was it fate he wondered, or was he simply off his rocker? Scenarios he created in his head often proved themselves more exhilarating than his reality. How was it that Roland managed to play a minor character in his own life’s film? His purpose to the storyline yet to be discovered, constantly waiting for his moment to star. He knew he was insane in thinking this random Australian woman would have anything to do with him finding his purpose but god, at this rate he was reaching for any slither of hope. Marianne on the other hand, had paid no attention to the pale man on the platform with the tightly knotted shoes and sweaty ticket in hand. Her mind was elsewhere. … The soft whistle of the air that rushed in through the slightly cracked open louvre. The repetitive beat of the wheels on the track. The comfort of being a fly on the wall, snippets of a conversation here and there. As if sinking into a dream, the sound around Roland muffled. Rays of sun kissed his closed eyelids and sunk through his body. Warmed from the inside out. A feeling people got on their knees and prayed for in winter season of his hometown. He was the same Roland a universe away. He didn’t miss the Tower Hamlets Roland; he didn’t miss much about Tower Hamlets at all.

Blinking a few times, he cleared his vision. It was her. Golden-brown hair. His heart beat two times too fast and his ability to make the situation less awkward always two times too slow. She was crying and Roland had no god damn idea what to do, he hid behind the silence between them like a child hides behind their hands. More in shock than anything else Roland questioned if he should even say anything to the woman. Such a public display of emotion was not something Roland knew his way around. God, he thought, he really had become that close-minded Tower Hamlets prat. This was the authenticity that came with the red dirt. This was what Roland was searching for. He saw the way her brown eyes darted back and forth outside the window, grasping the image of objects before they flew past. Her eyes, small pots of honey in the sun. Dripping sorrow. ‘I… I couldn’t help but notice you… you’re… are you alright?’ The most courageous thing Roland had done in a month. Using the back of her delicate hand she wiped her cheeks and assured him that she was, or at least she would be. She looked down at her untied shoes, hiding her face from him. He reached his hand out and rested it on her shoulder. Perhaps it was the best way he knew how to comfort her, at least he wasn’t fumbling words. Marianne’s insight She was sick and she knew it. She had thought it for quite some time but now it was certain. How good is a certain fate, huh? A lack of potential possibilities. Her mind was clouded as she walked aboard the train. Maybe because of her condition or maybe just because she couldn’t stop thinking about it. Marianne walked along the aisle swaying with the train as it coasted along the rails. She found a seat opposite a man who appeared to be sleeping. Trying to focus on one object outside the window was enough to give someone a headache she thought as she watched streaks of colour fill the glass panel. She squeezed her hands into fists. Out of anger or helplessness she did not know. Though Marianne’s perspective was always based of fact she would at times allow herself to imagine things differently. She would imagine herself saying ‘yes’ instead of ‘no’ or ‘when’ instead of ‘why’. Her life could have taken so many paths, but much lie the train she sat on, her destination was set. Her heart skipped a beat at a sudden sound of his voice. ‘I… I couldn’t help but notice…’. Spit it out, she thought. ‘You… you’re… are you alright?’ ‘Yes, yes I’m fine thank you, at least I will be…’ She struggled to find the word. Ironic. It seemed she was no longer in the position to look down upon someone a little slower off the mark than herself. Marianne looked down at her untied shoes and rolled her eyes so the man could not see. At his touch on her shoulder she understood that this man on the train would soon disembark but that would not be his final destination.

Rising from her chair she indicated she was leaving. There was nothing here for her. ‘Goodbye,’ he mumbled. ‘Yeah,’ replied Marianne, ‘See you later.’ Roland’s insight ‘See you later’ she had said to him. So much hope in a five-letter word. Later. And finally, he understood what was meant by the word bittersweet; he was sad to see her go yet content when he considered that he may have just met a major character in the storyline of this life of his. Imaginative spoken/multimodal response to the play Constellations by Nick Payne. This sample has been selected because it demonstrates a discerning use of the spoken digital story to engage audiences in a reimagining of the character s of Roland and Marianne in a different cultural context, and makes discerning use of the ways cultural assumptions, attitudes, values and beliefs about relationships and freewill underpin both Nick Payne’s play and the reimagined text so as to invite audiences to reinterpret and reflect on the base text and its underpinning cultural assumptions and values. This response makes discerning use of aesthetic features and stylistic devices and their effects, such as the motif of the train (The Ghan) and the visual imagery of water colours and its associations including the ladies face, the eye and the metaphorical reference to bees and honey. The deliberate approach to narration allows for a strong development of a character to support the perspectives in the reimagined text and to prompt emotional and critical audience responses, and to allow for the subtle and complex creation of concepts, identities, times and places in the reimagined text.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":""}
