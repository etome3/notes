Alexander, at only 20 years of age, was faced with “external dangers on every side.” Alexander made a lightning march through central Greece, forcing them tor 1 acknowledge his succession to his father's position as supreme leader of Greeee 2 agree to go ahead with the Macedonian/Greek invasion of Asia. Threats from the north Fecling sccure in the loyalty of the Greeks, Alexander returned north to deal with the Thracians and iyrians, who saw the young king on the throne as an opportunity to cause trouble. In335, Alexander headed for the Danube River to deal with the Triballians of Thrace in a swift offensive was, since ‘these people bordered upon Macedon and since his expedition [Persian] would take him so far from home he did not think it wisc to leave them in his rcar, unless they were thoroughly erushed.\"” In this march of 480 kilometres over mountains and among hostile tribes, the young king revealed his abilty to command and motivate his men, deal with logistical challenges, and devise and implement innovative offensive tactics and flexible plans to outwit a cunning cnemy. Although he routed the Triballians and captured rich booty, Alexander was determined to cross the Danube - ‘the greatest of rivers'~ and face the tribes on its northern side.

By using his 120-decp phalanx in an aggressive way with massed and swishing sarissas and clashing shiclds, he routed the Ilyrians by fear.
