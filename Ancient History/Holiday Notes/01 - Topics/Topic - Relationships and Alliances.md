# Relationships and Alliances

This note covers Alexander's key personal and political relationships, which were often intertwined and crucial to his success and the internal dynamics of his campaign.

## Key Relationships

### Political Marriages
Alexander used marriage as a tool of statecraft to solidify alliances and advance his policy of fusion. These were not based on romance but on strategic calculation.

> [!quote] Source on the Susa Marriages
> "He also held weddings at Susa for himself and his companions... about eighty in all – married the most noble daughters of the Persians and the Medes. These marriages were conducted according to Persian custom."

### Conflict with Companions
As the campaign progressed and Alexander's style of rule became more autocratic, his relationship with his Macedonian generals and veterans deteriorated, leading to several crises.
