# Military Genius and Strategy

This topic analyzes Alexander's effectiveness as a military commander, focusing on his battlefield tactics, strategic aims, and use of psychological warfare.

## Key Aspects

### Combined Arms Tactics
Alexander's mastery lay in the seamless integration of his army's diverse components: the [[Concept - Macedonian Phalanx]] as the "anvil" to hold the enemy, and the [[Concept - Companion Cavalry (Hetairoi)]] as the "hammer" to deliver the decisive blow.

### Evolving War Aims
The campaign began as a "war of revenge" against Persia but quickly evolved into a war of conquest, driven by Alexander's ambition (*pothos*) and the unfolding strategic situation.

### Precautionary Ferocity (Terror Tactics)
Alexander often used overwhelming force and brutality to make examples of cities that resisted, such as Thebes and Tyre, to deter future rebellions.

### The Role of Fortune (Tychē)
Historians have long debated whether Alexander's unbroken string of victories was a result of pure genius, incredible luck, or a combination of both.

> Overtoom critiques Billows' argument that Polybius saw Alexander's success as primarily luck, stating: "His argument is unconvincing and does not establish Polybius' view of Alexander as negative."
