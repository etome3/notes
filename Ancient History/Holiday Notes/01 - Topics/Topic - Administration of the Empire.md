# Administration of the Empire

This note examines how Alexander governed the vast, multicultural empire he conquered.

## Key Policies

### Satrapy System
Alexander largely retained the existing Persian administrative framework of satrapies. He often appointed Macedonians to the highest positions but also kept or promoted Persian nobles, a pragmatic approach that utilized local expertise and fostered a degree of continuity.

### Foundation of Cities
Alexander founded numerous cities, named "Alexandria," throughout the empire. These served multiple purposes:
- **Military Garrisons:** To control strategic locations and suppress dissent.
- **Administrative Centers:** To manage the surrounding regions.
- **Cultural Hubs:** To act as centers for the dissemination of Hellenistic culture, language, and trade.

### Economic Control
Control over the empire's resources was centralized under the king. This included the vast wealth of the Persian treasuries, as well as revenue from mines, timber, and harbors, which funded his campaigns and administrative costs.
