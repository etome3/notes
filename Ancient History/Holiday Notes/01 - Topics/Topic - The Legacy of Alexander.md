# The Legacy of Alexander

This topic assesses the long-term impact of Alexander's conquests on both the Greek and Persian worlds.

## Key Legacies

### The Hellenistic World
Whether intentional or not, Alexander's conquests shattered the old world order and ushered in the [[Concept - Hellenistic Era]]. This period was characterized by:
- The spread of Greek language (*koine*), culture, and political structures across the Near East.
- The fusion of Greek and Eastern traditions in art, religion, and philosophy.
- The establishment of major centers of learning and commerce, such as Alexandria in Egypt.

### A Model for Conquerors
Alexander became the archetypal conqueror, a model for countless later rulers, from Roman generals like Pompey and Caesar to Napoleon.

> — John Keegan, quoted in [[Source - Allen, Alexander the Great or the Terrible]]

### The "Great vs. Terrible" Debate
Alexander's legacy is inherently dualistic. He is remembered as both a brilliant, visionary leader and a ruthless, destructive tyrant. This debate continues to shape how he is viewed in both Western and Eastern cultures.
