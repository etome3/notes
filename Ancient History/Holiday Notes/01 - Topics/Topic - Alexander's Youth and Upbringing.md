# Alexander's Youth and Upbringing

This note covers the formative influences on Alexander's character, including his education, family dynamics, and the cultural values of the Macedonian court.

## Key Influences

### Education by Aristotle
Aristotle's tutelage was fundamental in shaping Alexander's worldview, instilling in him a thirst for knowledge and a specific philosophical outlook on greatness.

> Alexander's "major focus was on the concept of the 'Man of Great Soul', a man who sought honour through competition throughout his life."

### Heroic Myths and the Homeric Code
Alexander was deeply influenced by Greek mythology, particularly the figure of Achilles from Homer's *Iliad*, which he saw as a model for his own life and actions.

### Relationship with Parents
The intense and often conflicting relationship with his parents, [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Person - Olympias]], created a volatile and ambitious character.

> [!quote] Source
> "The disturbances in the royal household, brought about by his marriages and his love affairs, caused problems in his kingdom very similar to those in the women's quarters of the palace and resulted in great quarrels between Alexander and his father, which the bad temper of Olympias, an envious and sullen woman, made still worse, as she encouraged the young man."
