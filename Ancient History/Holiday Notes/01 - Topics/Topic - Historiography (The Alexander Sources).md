# Historiography (The Alexander Sources)

This note analyzes the primary and secondary sources for the life of Alexander, highlighting the challenges historians face in constructing a reliable narrative.

## The Problem of the Sources
There are no surviving contemporary accounts of Alexander's life. The main literary sources we rely on were written 300-500 years after his death.

### The Main Surviving Sources
- **Arrian:** Generally considered the most reliable, as he heavily based his work on the lost histories of Ptolemy (one of Alexander's generals) and Aristobulus.
- **Plutarch:** Wrote a biography focusing on Alexander's character and moral qualities, not a straightforward history.
- **Diodorus Siculus:** Provides a universal history that includes Alexander's reign. Often criticized for inconsistencies.
- **Quintus Curtius Rufus:** A Roman historian who wrote a more sensationalist and rhetorical account, often critical of Alexander's character.

### The "Great Man" vs. "Terrible Tyrant" Debate
The interpretation of Alexander has shifted dramatically over time, reflecting the values of the historians themselves.
- **19th Century (e.g., Sir William Tarn):** Viewed Alexander as a secular saint and a civilizing hero.
- **Modern Era:** A more critical view has emerged, emphasizing his brutality, megalomania, and the destructive aspects of his conquests.

> Overtoom argues against a purely negative reading of Polybius's view: "In reality, Polybius' opinion of Alexander is far more evenhanded, balancing between respect for his accomplishments and Polybius' agenda..."
