# Alexander's Character and Beliefs

This topic delves into the complex and often contradictory nature of Alexander's personality, his personal beliefs, and his driving motivations.

## Key Traits

### Ambition and *Pothos*
Alexander was driven by an insatiable desire (*pothos*) for glory, conquest, and to surpass all human limits. This ambition was shaped by his education and his rivalry with his father, [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]].

> "Under Aristotle's tutelage Alexander developed: an insatiable curiosity... a determination to go beyond everyone else in excellence... a desire to become a 'Man of Great Soul'."
> — [[Source - Bradley, The Ancient World Transformed]]

### Belief in his Divine Connection
Alexander actively cultivated the idea of his own divinity, stemming from his mother [[Person - Olympias]]'s claims about his birth and reinforced by his visit to the Oracle of Siwah. This was both a personal belief and a powerful political tool.

> "That Alexander kept claiming divine origin for himself does not seem to me a serious fault, and perhaps it was a device directed at his subjects to gain greater respect."
> — Arrian, in [[Source - OCR, Alexander the Great Sourcebook]]

### Ruthlessness and Magnanimity
Alexander's character was marked by extremes. He could be incredibly magnanimous to defeated enemies like Porus, yet brutally ruthless to those who defied him, as seen in the destruction of [[Event - Destruction of Thebes (335 BC)|Thebes]] or the execution of [[Person - Parmenion]].

> "The king's undeniable ruthlessness can be seen either as needless brutality, or as necessitous firmness in his utter determination to achieve total victory."
> — [[Source - Allen, Alexander the Great or the Terrible]]

### Adherence to the Homeric Code
His actions were often guided by a [[Concept - Homeric Code of Honor|Homeric code of honor]], modeling himself on his mythical ancestor, Achilles. This influenced his conduct in battle and his obsession with personal glory.
