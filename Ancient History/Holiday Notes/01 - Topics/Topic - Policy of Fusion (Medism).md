# Policy of Fusion (Medism)

This topic explores Alexander's controversial policy of blending Macedonian, Greek, and Persian cultures, particularly in the military and at court.

## Key Elements

### Adoption of Persian Customs
Alexander increasingly adopted Persian royal customs, including their style of dress and court rituals. This was a pragmatic move to legitimize his rule in the eyes of his new subjects but caused significant resentment among his Macedonian veterans.

### The Proskynesis Affair
The attempt to introduce *proskynesis* (the Persian custom of prostrating before the king) was a major flashpoint. It highlighted the cultural chasm between the Macedonian view of a king as a "first among equals" and the Persian concept of a divine, absolute monarch.

### Inter-marriage and Military Integration
- The [[Event - Mass Marriages at Susa (324 BC)]] were a deliberate act of policy to merge the Macedonian and Persian ruling classes.
- Alexander also integrated Persian soldiers into the Macedonian army, even training a corps of young Persians (the *Epigoni*) in the Macedonian style of warfare.
