# The Succession Crisis (Diadochi)

This note covers the events immediately following Alexander's death and the subsequent conflicts between his generals (the *Diadochi*) over the division of his vast empire.

## The Immediate Aftermath
Alexander's sudden death in 323 BC left a power vacuum. He had no clear or adult heir.
- His wife Roxane was pregnant with the future Alexander IV.
- His half-brother, Philip III Arrhidaeus, was considered mentally unfit to rule.

> When asked to whom he left his kingdom, Alexander is famously said to have replied, **"To the strongest"** (*tôi kratistôi*). This, whether historical or not, set the stage for decades of conflict.

## The Wars of the Diadochi
The struggle for power broke out almost immediately among his most powerful marshals, including:
- **Perdiccas:** The initial regent, who was quickly assassinated.
- **Ptolemy:** Secured Egypt, establishing a long-lasting dynasty.
- **Antigonus Monophthalmus ("the One-Eyed"):** Attempted to keep the empire united under his rule but was defeated.
- **Seleucus:** Carved out a massive kingdom in the east, from Asia Minor to India.
- **Cassander:** Took control of Macedonia.

This period of warfare ultimately led to the fragmentation of Alexander's empire into several large Hellenistic kingdoms.
