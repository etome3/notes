### Unification of Greece
Through a combination of diplomacy, bribery, and military force, Philip subdued the Greek city-states and united them under Macedonian leadership in the League of Corinth. This established the [[Concept - Hegemony|hegemony]] necessary to launch his planned invasion of Persia.

## Relationship with Alexander
His relationship with his son was complex, marked by both affection and intense rivalry. The tension escalated in his final years, particularly after his marriage to Cleopatra Eurydice, which threatened Alexander's succession.
