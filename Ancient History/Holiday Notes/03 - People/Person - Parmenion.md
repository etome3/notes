# Parmenion

## Key Information
- **Died:** 330 BC
- **Role:** Macedonian General, second-in-command to both [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Person - Alexander the Great]].

## Summary
Parmenion was Philip II's most trusted and experienced general. He played a crucial role in Philip's victories and in securing the throne for Alexander. During the invasion of Asia, he served as Alexander's second-in-command, typically commanding the left wing of the army in major battles.

## Role in Alexander's Campaigns
- **A Voice of Caution:** Parmenion consistently represented a more cautious and conventional strategic approach. He often advised Alexander against taking unnecessary risks.
    - At the [[Event - Battle of the Granicus (334 BC)]], he advised against a direct river crossing.
    - At the [[Event - Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC)]], he advised a night attack.
    - Alexander rejected his advice on both occasions, and was victorious.
- **Commander of the Left Wing:** In battle, Parmenion was entrusted with the vital defensive role of holding the left wing of the Macedonian army while Alexander executed the decisive attack with the right.

## Execution
In 330 BC, Parmenion's son, Philotas, was convicted of treason and executed. Though there was no evidence against Parmenion himself, Alexander, fearing the old general might seek revenge for his son's death, had him assassinated. This was a ruthless and pragmatic act to eliminate a potential threat.

## Significance
Parmenion represents the "old guard" of Philip's generation. His relationship with Alexander highlights the tension between youthful audacity and veteran caution. His execution marks a turning point in Alexander's reign, demonstrating a growing paranoia and ruthlessness.
