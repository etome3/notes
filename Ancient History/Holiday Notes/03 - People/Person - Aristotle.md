## Summary
Aristotle was one of the most influential philosophers in Western history. For several years, he served as the personal tutor to the young Alexander, a role that had a profound, though sometimes debated, impact on the future conqueror's intellectual development and worldview.

## Tutelage of Alexander
Hired by [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]], Aristotle instructed Alexander and a group of other young Macedonian nobles in a wide range of subjects.

A key concept he imparted was that of the "Man of Great Soul" (*megalopsychos*), a man who seeks honor through great deeds and recognizes his own superiority. This idea deeply resonated with Alexander's own ambitious nature.

## Relationship with Alexander
- **Early Influence:** Aristotle's teachings clearly shaped Alexander's intellectual curiosity and his framework for understanding the world.
- **Later Estrangement:** The relationship grew strained in later years. Alexander's adoption of Persian customs and his increasingly autocratic behavior clashed with Aristotle's Greek-centric worldview. The execution of Aristotle's nephew, Callisthenes, after the [[Event - Proskynesis Affair (327 BC)|Proskynesis Affair]] likely caused a permanent rift.
- **Poisoning Conspiracy:** Some ancient sources, likely hostile propaganda, even implicated Aristotle in the plot to poison Alexander at the end of his life.
