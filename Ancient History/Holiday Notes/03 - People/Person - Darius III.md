# Darius III

## Key Information
- **Reign:** 336-330 BC
- **Role:** The last Achaemenid King of Persia.
- **Opponent of:** [[Person - Alexander the Great]]

## Summary
Darius III was the ruler of the vast Persian Empire when Alexander invaded. He was not of the direct royal line and had come to the throne under difficult circumstances. He is primarily remembered for his defeats at the hands of Alexander.

## Confrontations with Alexander

### Battle of Issus (333 BC)
In their first encounter, Darius outmaneuvered Alexander initially but was decisively beaten on a narrow battlefield that favored the smaller Macedonian army. When Alexander's cavalry charge broke through the lines, Darius fled, abandoning his army and his family to capture.

### Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC)
Darius prepared meticulously for their final confrontation, choosing a wide, flat plain to maximize his numerical advantage. However, Alexander's superior tactics again proved decisive. A charge led by Alexander directly at Darius's position caused the Great King to flee once more, leading to the collapse of his army.

> [!quote] Murison's Assessment
> C.L. Murison's analysis of the lead-up to Issus challenges the traditional view of Darius as simply cowardly and incompetent, suggesting his strategic decisions were more complex than often portrayed. He argues that Darius's plan to cut Alexander's supply lines was sound, but his choice of battlefield was a fatal error.

## Death
After the defeat at Gaugamela, Darius fled east, pursued by Alexander. His authority collapsed, and he was eventually betrayed and assassinated by his own satraps, including Bessus, who then declared himself king. Alexander gave Darius a royal burial at Persepolis.

## Significance
Darius III is the tragic figure in Alexander's story. While he was not without courage or ability, he was ultimately outmatched by one of history's greatest military geniuses. His defeats and death marked the end of the Achaemenid Empire, which had dominated the Near East for over two centuries.
