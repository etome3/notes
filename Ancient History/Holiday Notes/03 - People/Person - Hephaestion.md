> [!quote] Arrian's Account
> "Writers have given very different accounts of Alexander's grieving; they all agreed that his grief was very great, but there are different versions of what he actually did, dependent on the goodwill or envy each felt towards Hephaestion or Alexander himself."

## Significance
Hephaestion's life and death provide the clearest window into Alexander's personal emotional world. His death devastated Alexander and may have contributed to the king's own decline in health in his final months.
