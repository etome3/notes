# Olympias

## Key Information
- **From:** Epirus
- **Spouse:** [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]]
- **Mother of:** [[Person - Alexander the Great]]

## Summary
Olympias was the fourth wife of Philip II and the mother of Alexander. She was a formidable and ambitious figure, known for her fiery temperament and her devotion to mystic religious cults. She played a crucial role in securing the throne for her son.

## Character and Influence
- **Ambitious and Protective:** Her primary goal was to ensure her son, Alexander, would inherit Philip's throne. She saw other wives and their children as direct threats.
- **Religious Devotion:** She was a passionate devotee of the ecstatic cult of Dionysus and was said to handle snakes as part of her rituals. This contributed to her formidable and somewhat fearsome reputation.
- **Volatile Relationship with Philip:** Her relationship with Philip was stormy and deteriorated completely when he married a Macedonian noblewoman, Cleopatra Eurydice. This led to a major rift between father and son, with Olympias and Alexander going into temporary exile.

## Role in Philip's Assassination
Olympias is a primary suspect in the conspiracy to assassinate Philip II. She had the motive (revenge and securing Alexander's succession) and the reputation for ruthless action. After Philip's death, she had his last wife, Cleopatra, and her infant child murdered.
