# Concept - Sarissa

The *sarissa* was the signature weapon of the [[Concept - Macedonian Phalanx|Macedonian phalanx]], introduced by [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]]. It was a type of pike of extraordinary length.

## Description
- **Length:** The sarissa was much longer than the traditional Greek hoplite spear (*dory*). Sources give lengths ranging from 15 to 18 feet (approx. 4.5 to 5.5 meters).
- **Composition:** It had a sharp iron head and a bronze butt-spike, which could be used to anchor the weapon in the ground or to finish off fallen enemies. The shaft was made of strong, flexible cornel wood.
- **Two-Handed Weapon:** Because of its length and weight, it had to be wielded with two hands. This necessitated the use of a smaller, lighter shield (*pelta*) slung over the shoulder.

> "Philip developed a much-improved phalanx in which each infantryman (pike-man) carried a 5.5-metre-long sarissa - much longer than those formerly carried by Greek heavy infantry. Since sarissas could only be held in two hands, the shields became smaller, slung on the left shoulder and arm."

## Tactical Use
When a phalanx was formed for battle, the sarissas of the first five ranks of soldiers could all be projected forward, creating an impenetrable hedge of spear points that no enemy could approach.

> "...the length of the sarissa meant that in a Macedonian phalanx formation, at least five spear points could protrude beyond each man in the front rank, effectively creating a wall of spear tips."

## Significance
The sarissa was a key component of Philip's military revolution. It gave his infantry a significant reach advantage over any contemporary opponent, making the Macedonian phalanx nearly invincible in a frontal assault.
