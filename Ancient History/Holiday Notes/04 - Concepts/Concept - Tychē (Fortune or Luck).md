# Concept - Tychē (Fortune or Luck)

*Tychē* is the Greek concept of fortune, luck, or chance. In the Hellenistic period, it was often personified as a goddess who governed the fates of individuals and cities.

## The Role of Fortune in Alexander's Story
The debate over the role of *tychē* in Alexander's success is central to his historiography. Was his unbroken string of victories the result of his own genius, or was he simply the beneficiary of incredible good luck?

### Ancient Views
- **A Great Compliment:** For many ancient writers, to say that a person was favored by Fortune was a great compliment, suggesting divine backing.
- **Demetrius of Phalerum:** As quoted by Polybius, Demetrius used the rise of Macedon and the fall of Persia as the prime example of Fortune's power to overturn the world order.
- **The "Alexander owed everything to luck" argument:** This view was often used by Alexander's detractors to diminish his achievements.

### Modern Debate
The debate continues today.
- **The Case for Luck:**
    - The assassination of [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]] at the perfect moment.
    - The death of the brilliant Persian general Memnon of Rhodes early in the campaign.
    - The flight of [[Person - Darius III]] at both [[Event - Battle of Issus (333 BC)|Issus]] and [[Event - Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC)]].
- **The Case for Genius:**
    - Alexander consistently created his own opportunities through brilliant strategy and risk-taking.
    - He was able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances.
    - As the saying goes, "fortune favors the bold."
