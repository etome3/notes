# Concept - Companion Cavalry (Hetairoi)

The *Hetairoi*, or Companion Cavalry, were the elite heavy cavalry of the Macedonian army and the personal companions of the king. They were the decisive "hammer" in Alexander's "hammer and anvil" tactic.

## Composition and Role
- **Recruitment:** Originally composed of Macedonian nobles who were the personal "companions" (*hetairoi*) of the king. [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]] expanded their numbers significantly.
- **Weaponry:** They were heavy cavalry, armed with a lance (likely a shorter version of the [[Concept - Sarissa|sarissa]]) and a sword for close combat.
- **Formation:** They often charged in a wedge formation, which was effective at piercing enemy lines.
- **Leadership:** The king, particularly [[Person - Alexander the Great]], would lead the charge in person at the head of the Companions, targeting the enemy's command or a weak point in their line.

## Tactical Use
The Companions were the primary offensive and shock element of the Macedonian army. Their role was to:
1.  Exploit a gap or weakness in the enemy line created by the advance of the [[Concept - Macedonian Phalanx|phalanx]].
2.  Deliver a decisive, overwhelming charge to break the enemy formation.
3.  Attack the enemy's flank or rear, or target the enemy commander directly.

## Significance
The Companion Cavalry was arguably the most effective and important component of Alexander's army. Their ability to deliver a devastating, well-timed charge was the key to victory in almost all of his major battles, including [[Event - Battle of the Granicus (334 BC)|Granicus]], [[Event - Battle of Issus (333 BC)|Issus]], and [[Event - Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC)|Gaugamela]].
