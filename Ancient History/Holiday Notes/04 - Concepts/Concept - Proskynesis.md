# Concept - Proskynesis

*Proskynesis* was the traditional Persian court ritual of showing deference to a person of higher social rank, most importantly the Great King.

## The Act
The act itself could vary in intensity depending on the relative status of the individuals:
- For a near-equal, it might be a simple bow of the head or blowing a kiss.
- For a social inferior before the king, it involved full prostration on the ground.

## The Cultural Clash
The attempt by [[Person - Alexander the Great]] to introduce this custom to his court was a major source of conflict, known as the [[Event - Proskynesis Affair (327 BC)]].
- **Persian View:** For the Persians, proskynesis was a standard and expected sign of political respect for the office of the king. It did not necessarily imply the king was a god.
- **Greek View:** For the Greeks and Macedonians, the act of prostration was an honor reserved exclusively for the gods. To perform it for a mortal man, even a king, was seen as blasphemous and a humiliating act of servility, unworthy of a free man.

## Significance
The proskynesis affair is the single clearest example of the cultural chasm between the Greco-Macedonian and Persian worlds that Alexander was trying to bridge. It demonstrates the limits of his [[Topic - Policy of Fusion (Medism)|policy of fusion]] and the deep-seated resentment it caused among his own people.
