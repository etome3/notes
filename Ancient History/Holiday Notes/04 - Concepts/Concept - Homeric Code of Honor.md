# Concept - Homeric Code of Honor

The Homeric Code of Honor refers to the system of values and ethics portrayed in Homer's epic poems, the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*. This code was a fundamental part of the aristocratic Greek worldview and profoundly influenced [[Person - Alexander the Great]].

## Key Principles
- ***Timē* (Honor/Value):** The public acknowledgment of a warrior's worth and status. It is a zero-sum game; one man's gain in honor often comes at another's expense.
- ***Arete* (Excellence/Virtue):** The quality of excellence in all things, but especially in combat. It is the defining quality of a hero.
- ***Kleos* (Glory/Fame):** The ultimate goal of a hero. It is the fame that lives on after death, achieved through great deeds on the battlefield. Since the Homeric afterlife was a bleak and shadowy existence, achieving undying glory was a form of immortality.
- **Competition (*Agon*):** Life is a constant struggle to prove one's worth and be recognized as the "best" (*aristos*).

## Influence on Alexander
Alexander was steeped in this code from a young age. He traveled with an annotated copy of the *Iliad* and explicitly modeled himself on his mythical ancestor, Achilles.

His actions can often be understood through this lens:
- His constant need to be at the forefront of every battle, taking immense personal risks.
- His desire to surpass the deeds of all others, including his father and even the gods and heroes of myth (e.g., at the [[Event - Siege of the Aornus Rock (326 BC)|Aornus Rock]]).
- His extreme reaction to perceived slights, as seen in the [[Event - Death of Cleitus the Black (328 BC)|murder of Cleitus]].
