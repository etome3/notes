# Concept - Hegemony

*Hegemonia* is a Greek term meaning leadership or dominance, especially by one state over a coalition or league of other states. It is distinct from direct rule or empire.

## Description
A *hegemon* (leader state) holds its position through a combination of:
- **Military Power:** The ability to defeat any potential rivals.
- **Diplomacy and Prestige:** The consent (whether willing or coerced) of the other member states.
- **Shared Goals:** The hegemon often leads the coalition in a common cause.

The member states retain their internal autonomy but their foreign policy is directed by the hegemon.

## Philip and Alexander as Hegemons
- **The League of Corinth:** After the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]] established the League of Corinth, which included all major Greek states except Sparta.
- **Philip as Hegemon:** Philip was appointed *hegemon* of the League. This gave him command of the combined Greek forces for his planned invasion of Persia.
- **Alexander Inherits the Title:** After Philip's assassination, [[Person - Alexander the Great]] ruthlessly re-asserted Macedonian control (e.g., the [[Event - Destruction of Thebes (335 BC)|destruction of Thebes]]) and had himself confirmed as the new hegemon.

## From Hegemon to Absolute Ruler
The concept of hegemony was a Greek political idea. As Alexander's conquests took him deep into Asia, his style of rule shifted from that of a *hegemon* of a league of allies to that of an absolute monarch and emperor in the Persian tradition. This shift was a major source of tension with his Macedonian and Greek followers.
