# Concept - Macedonian Phalanx

The Macedonian phalanx was the core infantry formation of the armies of [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Person - Alexander the Great]]. It was a significant evolution of the traditional Greek hoplite phalanx.

## Key Features
- **Primary Weapon:** The [[Concept - Sarissa|sarissa]], a very long pike that gave the formation an unparalleled defensive and offensive reach.
- **Formation:** The soldiers (phalangites) were arranged in a dense, rectangular block, typically 16 ranks deep. The sarissas of the first five ranks were leveled horizontally, creating a formidable wall of spear points.
- **Smaller Shield:** Because the sarissa required two hands, the phalangites carried a smaller, lighter shield (the *pelta*) strapped to their left forearm, leaving both hands free.
- **Combined Arms:** The phalanx was vulnerable on its flanks and rear. Its success depended on being protected by other units, particularly light infantry and cavalry, in a [[Topic - Military Genius and Strategy|combined arms system]].

## Tactical Role
The phalanx was the "anvil" in Alexander's "hammer and anvil" tactic. Its role was to:
1.  Engage and fix the main body of the enemy infantry in a frontal assault.
2.  Hold them in place, absorbing pressure and preventing them from maneuvering.
3.  Create the opportunity for the "hammer"—the [[Concept - Companion Cavalry (Hetairoi)|Companion Cavalry]]—to deliver the decisive blow to the enemy's flank or rear.

## Significance
The Macedonian phalanx, as reformed by Philip II, was the most dominant infantry formation of its age. Its success was a key factor in the military supremacy of Macedon under both Philip and Alexander.
