# Source - Murison, Darius III and the Battle of Issus

- **Author:** C. L. Murison
- **Title:** "Darius III and the Battle of Issus"
- **Type:** Modern academic article (Historia, 1972)

## Key Arguments
Murison's article is a detailed strategic and topographical analysis of the events leading up to the [[Event - Battle of Issus (333 BC)]]. He challenges the traditional ancient and modern portrayal of [[Person - Darius III]] as a cowardly and incompetent commander.

### Re-evaluating Darius's Strategy
Murison argues that Darius's initial plan was strategically sound.
- Darius had chosen a wide, open plain at Sochoi to await Alexander, a battlefield that would have favored his numerically superior army and cavalry.
- He only abandoned this favorable position and moved to the narrow plain of Issus because Alexander's delays (due to illness and campaigning in Cilicia) led him to believe Alexander was afraid to advance.

> "Darius left a carefully prepared battle-site of his own choosing on open, level ground, and ended up fighting in a small, rough, and even hilly enclosure by the sea. Why should he have done such a thing? A consensus of our ancient sources would seem to be that because of the delays caused by Alexander's illness... Darius decided that Alexander would advance no further."

### The "Official" Version as Propaganda
Murison suggests that the ancient accounts, which largely stem from the "official" Macedonian version written by Callisthenes, deliberately portray Darius's actions as foolish and cowardly to magnify Alexander's achievement.

> "If any sense is to be made of Darius' actions, we must examine with care the moves made by both the Macedonians and the Persians, always bearing in mind the topography of the area from Tarsus to Sochoi... And doubtless this is the impression that was intended when Callisthenes wrote up the official, the 'approved' version of events leading to the battle of Issus."

### Alexander's Risk
Conversely, Murison highlights Alexander's carelessness in leaving his army divided for so long and failing to secure the northern passes, which allowed Darius to get behind him in the first place.

> "As for Alexander, his carelessness in keeping his army divided for so long and his failure to secure the northern passes show that, although he may have been a brilliant tactician, he had yet much to learn about the importance of sound strategy and thorough and careful reconnaissance."

## Relevance
This source provides a critical re-examination of a key event in Alexander's career. It demonstrates the importance of questioning the bias of the primary sources and considering the strategic realities from the Persian perspective.
