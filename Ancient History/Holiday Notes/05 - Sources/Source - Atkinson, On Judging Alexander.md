# Source - Atkinson, On Judging Alexander

- **Author:** John Atkinson
- **Title:** "On Judging Alexander: A Matter of Honour"
- **Type:** Modern academic article (Acta Classica, 2007)

## Key Arguments
Atkinson's article examines the "code of honour" that motivated Alexander's actions. He argues that Alexander's behavior must be understood within the context of the competitive, aristocratic values of his time, which were heavily influenced by the [[Concept - Homeric Code of Honor|Homeric code]].

### Evolving Aims and Honour
Atkinson suggests that Alexander's aims and his methods of seeking honour evolved throughout his career.
- **Initial Aim:** The war began as a Panhellenic war of revenge against Persia.
- **Escalation:** The visit to the Oracle at Siwah and the diplomatic exchanges with [[Person - Darius III]] led to a "progressive escalation in Alexander's declared intent." The goal shifted from revenge to outright conquest of the Persian Empire.

### Competing Codes of Honour
As Alexander moved deeper into Asia, he had to navigate and accommodate different codes of honour.
- **Macedonian/Greek Code:** Based on personal bravery, peer recognition, and the values of a warrior aristocracy.
- **Persian Code:** Based on deference to a divine, absolute monarch.

This clash of codes was a major source of tension, exemplified by the [[Event - Proskynesis Affair (327 BC)]].

### Pragmatism in Alliances and Marriages
Atkinson argues that Alexander's marriages were primarily political tools, not romantic affairs.

> [!quote] On the marriage to Roxane
> "But Alexander was more likely following his father's policy of using marriage as a means of winning over another princely family."

## Relevance
This source provides a sophisticated framework for judging Alexander's actions. Instead of applying modern morality, Atkinson insists on understanding Alexander within his own value system, centered on the pursuit of *timÄ“* (honour) and *kleos* (glory).
