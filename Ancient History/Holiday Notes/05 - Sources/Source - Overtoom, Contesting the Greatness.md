# Source - Overtoom, Contesting the Greatness

- **Author:** Nikolaus Leo Overtoom
- **Title:** *Contesting the Greatness of Alexander the Great: The Representation of Alexander in the Histories of Polybius and Livy*
- **Type:** Modern academic thesis (2011)

## Key Arguments
This work analyzes how the Hellenistic historian Polybius portrayed Alexander the Great. Overtoom argues against the view (proposed by scholars like Richard Billows) that Polybius had a consistently negative or hostile opinion of Alexander.

### Polybius's View was "Evenhanded"
Overtoom contends that Polybius presents a balanced and nuanced picture of Alexander, acknowledging both his incredible achievements and his flaws.

> "In reality, Polybius' opinion of Alexander is far more evenhanded, balancing between respect for his accomplishments and Polybius' agenda of representing the Romans as greater than Alexander."

### Critique of the "Negative View"
Overtoom systematically refutes the arguments for a negative Polybian view:
- **On the Sack of Thebes:** While Polybius calls the act "unjust and terrible," he also praises Alexander's piety in sparing the temples, which Billows downplays.
- **On Alexander's Fortune (Tychē):** Overtoom argues that the famous passage from Demetrius of Phalerum about Fortune's power is more about the fall of Persia and the rise of Macedon in general, and is not a specific claim that Alexander owed everything to luck.
- **On Alexander's War Aims:** Polybius presents the invasion of Persia as a justified war of revenge, a "suitable pretext," in contrast to his sharp criticism of the motives of other generals like Hannibal.
