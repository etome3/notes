- **Author:** Anonymous (B070075)
- **Title:** *The Military Revolution: What were Philip II's Reforms of the Macedonian Military and how Revolutionary were they?*
- **Type:** Modern academic dissertation

## Key Arguments
This dissertation details the comprehensive military reforms undertaken by [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]] and argues that they constituted a true "military revolution." This revolution was the essential precondition for the successes of both Philip and his son, [[Person - Alexander the Great]].

### Nature of the Reforms
The author analyzes the reforms across three categories: equipment, training, and tactics.
- **Equipment:** The most significant innovation was the introduction of the [[Concept - Sarissa|sarissa]], which necessitated a new, lighter shield and armor, making the infantry more mobile.
- **Training:** Philip created a professional, standing army with year-round training, constant drills, and harsh discipline. This forged a level of professionalism and morale previously unseen.
- **Tactics:** The core tactical innovation was the perfection of **combined arms warfare**, most famously the "hammer and anvil" tactic.

### The "Hammer and Anvil"
This was the signature tactic of the new Macedonian army.
- **The Anvil:** The [[Concept - Macedonian Phalanx|phalanx]], with its hedge of sarissas, would engage and fix the enemy's main infantry line.
- **The Hammer:** The elite [[Concept - Companion Cavalry (Hetairoi)|Companion Cavalry]] would then charge the enemy's flank or rear, delivering the decisive, battle-winning blow.

> "The strong pikeman-phalanx, protected and enhanced by hoplites, light cavalry and light infantry, could engage and hold the enemy infantry, serving as the 'anvil.' The 'hammer,' was the cavalry."

## Conclusion
The dissertation concludes that Philip's reforms were undeniably revolutionary. They transformed the Macedonian army from a disorganized militia into the most effective and advanced military machine of its time, enabling the subjugation of Greece and the conquest of the Persian Empire.

## Relevance
This source provides a detailed, systematic analysis of the military machine that Alexander inherited. It emphasizes that Alexander's genius lay in his masterful use of this tool, but that the tool itself was forged by his father.
