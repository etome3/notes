# Source - OCR, Alexander the Great Sourcebook

- **Author:** Oxford Cambridge and RSA (OCR)
- **Title:** *Prescribed Source Booklet: Alexander the Great 356-323 BC*
- **Type:** A curated collection of ancient source material for students.

## Content
This booklet contains translated excerpts from the major ancient historians who wrote about Alexander, primarily:
- **Plutarch:** From his *Life of Alexander*.
- **Arrian:** From his *Anabasis of Alexander*.
- **Diodorus Siculus:** From his *Library of History*.

It also includes some epigraphic and archaeological evidence, such as the Babylonian Astronomical Diary.

## Key Episodes Covered
The sourcebook provides primary accounts of most of the key events in Alexander's life, including:
- His birth and youth, including the story of Bucephalus ([[Topic - Alexander's Youth and Upbringing]]).
- The [[Event - Assassination of Philip II (336 BC)]].
- The major battles: [[Event - Battle of the Granicus (334 BC)|Granicus]], [[Event - Battle of Issus (333 BC)|Issus]], [[Event - Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC)|Gaugamela]].
- The [[Event - Siege of Tyre (332 BC)]].
- The [[Event - Burning of Persepolis (330 BC)]].
- The [[Event - Death of Cleitus the Black (328 BC)]].
- The [[Event - Proskynesis Affair (327 BC)]].
- The [[Event - Mass Marriages at Susa (324 BC)]].
- The [[Event - Death of Alexander (323 BC)]].

## Value and Limitations
- **Value:** It provides direct access to the ancient narratives, allowing for a close reading of how different authors portrayed the same events. This is essential for understanding the [[Topic - Historiography (The Alexander Sources)|historiography of Alexander]].
- **Limitations:** As a collection of excerpts, it lacks the full context of the original works. The translations themselves are a form of interpretation. The booklet does not include all available sources (e.g., Curtius Rufus, Justin).

## Relevance
This is a foundational source document for this vault, providing the raw material from the ancient world upon which all modern interpretations are built.
