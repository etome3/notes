# Source - Allen, Alexander the Great or the Terrible

- **Author:** Brooke Allen
- **Title:** "Alexander the Great - or the Terrible?"
- **Type:** Modern academic review article (The Hudson Review, 2005)

## Key Arguments
Allen's article explores the persistent duality in the historical interpretation of Alexander's character and legacy. She argues that posterity has never been able to decide whether he was a "good guy or a bad guy."

### The "Great Man" vs. "Terrible Tyrant" Debate
This is the central theme of the article.
- **The "Great":** The traditional European view, exemplified by historians like W.W. Tarn, saw Alexander as a "secular saint" spreading the "joys of Hellenic culture."
- **The "Terrible":** The opposing view, prominent in modern scholarship and in the lands he conquered, sees him as a "dispenser of death and destruction on a gigantic scale," a precursor to figures like Hitler or Stalin.

### Critique of "Hero-Worship"
Allen is highly critical of overly positive portrayals (like Oliver Stone's film) that ignore or downplay Alexander's brutality. She points to numerous atrocities:
- The [[Event - Destruction of Thebes (335 BC)|destruction of Thebes]].
- The [[Event - Burning of Persepolis (330 BC)|burning of Persepolis]].
- The execution of Batis, governor of Gaza.
- The massacre of 80,000 of the Sambastae tribe in India.

### Alexander's Pragmatism over Ideology
Allen argues that Alexander's actions were driven by military and political expediency, not by a grand "civilizing mission."
- His adoption of Persian customs ([[Topic - Policy of Fusion (Medism)|Medism]]) was a pragmatic tool for ruling a vast empire.
- He left behind autocratic satraps, not democracies.
- The Hellenistic culture that followed was more of a historical accident than a planned outcome.
