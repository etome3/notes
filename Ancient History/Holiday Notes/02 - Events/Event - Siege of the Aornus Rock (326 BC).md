# Event - Siege of the Aornus Rock (326 BC)

Aornus Rock (modern Pir Sar in Pakistan) was a formidable mountain fortress that was considered impregnable. Its capture was one of Alexander's most celebrated achievements, driven more by his desire for glory (*pothos*) than by strategic necessity.

## The Legend
According to legend, not even the demigod Heracles (Hercules) had been able to capture the rock. This story was all the motivation Alexander needed.

> "For this rock is a significant feature in this area, and the story goes that not even Heracles the son of Zeus was able to capture it... When Alexander heard about this, he was overcome with a strong desire to capture this mountain as well, especially because of the story about Heracles and the rock."

## The Siege
- The rock was a high mountain plateau with steep cliffs, accessible by only one difficult, man-made path. It had its own water supply and enough farmland to support a large garrison.
- Alexander's forces, with the help of local guides, secured a smaller peak nearby.
- From this position, his engineers began building a massive earthwork mound and bridge across the ravine separating them from the main fortress.
- Under the cover of missile fire from siege engines, the Macedonians advanced across the causeway and stormed the summit as the defenders attempted to flee.

## Significance
- The capture of Aornus Rock was a huge propaganda victory for Alexander. It reinforced his image as a hero who could surpass the deeds of the gods and heroes of myth.
- It demonstrated the incredible engineering skill and determination of his army.
- It was an act driven almost entirely by Alexander's personal ambition and his obsession with his own legend.
