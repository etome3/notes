# Event - Mutiny at the Hyphasis (326 BC)

After defeating King Porus at the Battle of the Hydaspes, Alexander wanted to press on further into India, towards the Ganges river. At the Hyphasis (modern Beas) river, his army refused to go any further.

## The Army's Exhaustion
By this point, the Macedonian army had been campaigning for eight years and had marched thousands of miles from home. They were:
- Physically and mentally exhausted.
- Worn down by constant fighting and the unfamiliar, harsh climate of the monsoon season.
- Demoralized by the prospect of facing even larger and more powerful Indian armies.
- Longing to return home to enjoy the spoils of their conquests.

## The Confrontation
- Alexander addressed his troops, speaking of the glory that awaited them and his desire to reach the end of the world.
- Coenus, one of his senior and most respected generals, spoke on behalf of the army. He respectfully but firmly laid out their reasons for wanting to turn back.
- Alexander, enraged at being defied, shut himself in his tent for three days, hoping the army would relent.
- When they did not, he finally gave in. He staged a sacrifice where the omens proved unfavorable for crossing, providing him with a face-saving reason to turn back.

> "At the Hyphasis it is not impossible that Alexander used Coenus to set up the mutinous scene that allowed him to appear to be persuaded not to advance further east to the Ganges. To defend his honour, Alexander could boast that in getting as far as the Hyphasis he had travelled further east than Dionysus..."

## Significance
- The mutiny marked the first and only time Alexander's ambition was checked by his own men.
- It showed the limits of his personal charisma and authority.
- It marked the easternmost point of his empire and the beginning of his long and arduous journey back to Babylon.
