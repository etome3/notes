# Event - Death of Alexander (323 BC)

Alexander the Great died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II in Babylon in June 323 BC, not yet 33 years old. The cause of his death remains one of history's great mysteries.

## The Circumstances
- After a prolonged period of heavy drinking following a banquet, Alexander fell ill with a fever.
- His condition worsened over the next ten to twelve days. He lost the ability to speak and eventually died.
- The court journals, as recorded by Arrian and Plutarch, provide a day-by-day account of his final illness.

> [!quote] The Court Journals (from Plutarch)
> "On the 18th day of the month Daesius, Alexander slept in the bath house because he had a fever. On the next day, he washed and went to his bedroom, where he spent the day playing dice with Medius... On the 28th day, towards evening, he died."

## Theories on the Cause of Death

### Natural Causes
- **Disease:** Most modern historians believe he died of a disease, likely malaria or typhoid fever, which were rampant in ancient Babylon. His body, weakened by years of campaigning, numerous wounds, and heavy drinking, would have been susceptible.
- **Alcohol Poisoning:** His final illness began after a long drinking bout, and alcohol may have been a contributing factor.

### Poisoning
- **Ancient Suspicions:** The ancient sources report that suspicion fell on Antipater, the regent of Macedonia, and his son Cassander. The poison was allegedly arranged by [[Person - Aristotle]] and administered by Alexander's cupbearer, Iolas.
- **Modern Theories:** Some modern authors have revived the poisoning theory, suggesting various possible toxins. However, the prolonged nature of his illness does not fit with most known ancient poisons.

> [!quote] Plutarch on the Poison Theory
> "The majority of historians consider this story about the poison to be completely made up; strong support for their view is given by the fact that... his body lay unattended in a stifling hot place, and showed no sign of such a drug, but remained pure and undefiled."

## Significance
Alexander's sudden death without a clear heir immediately triggered the collapse of his empire and the beginning of the [[Topic - The Succession Crisis (Diadochi)|Wars of the Diadochi]].
