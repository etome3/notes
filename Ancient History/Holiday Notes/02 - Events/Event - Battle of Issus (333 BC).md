# Event - Battle of Issus (333 BC)

The second major battle, and the first time Alexander faced [[Person - Darius III]] in person. The battle was fought on a narrow coastal plain in southern Turkey, which played to the Macedonians' strengths.

## The Maneuver
Darius, with a numerically superior army, managed to position his forces to the rear of Alexander's, cutting his supply lines. Alexander was forced to turn back and fight on a battlefield chosen by the Persians. However, the narrowness of the plain negated the Persian advantage in numbers.

## The Battle
- As at Granicus, Alexander led the [[Concept - Companion Cavalry (Hetairoi)]] in a decisive charge, aiming directly for Darius.
- The Macedonian [[Concept - Macedonian Phalanx|phalanx]] held the center against the Greek mercenaries in Darius's army.
- When Darius saw Alexander's charge breaking through, he fled the battlefield. His flight triggered the collapse and rout of the entire Persian army.
- Alexander captured Darius's family—his mother, wife, and children—whom he treated with respect.

## Significance
- A second major victory that confirmed Macedonian superiority.
- The flight of Darius was a massive blow to his prestige and authority.
- The capture of the royal family gave Alexander a powerful bargaining chip.
- The victory secured the entire eastern Mediterranean coast for Alexander, neutralizing the Persian fleet.
