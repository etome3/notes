# Event - Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC)

The decisive battle of Alexander's invasion of Persia, fought on a wide, open plain in modern-day Iraq. This was the final confrontation between Alexander and [[Person - Darius III]].

## The Setup
- Darius chose the battlefield carefully: a vast, flat plain that would allow him to deploy his numerically superior forces, including cavalry and scythed chariots, to their full effect.
- The Persians even leveled the ground to ensure their chariots would be effective.
- [[Person - Parmenion]] advised a night attack to counter the Persian numbers, but Alexander famously rejected this, declaring, "I do not steal my victory."

## The Battle
- Alexander advanced with his right wing at an angle, drawing the Persian cavalry on their left flank out to the side.
- This created a gap in the Persian line between their cavalry and their center.
- Alexander led the [[Concept - Companion Cavalry (Hetairoi)]] in a classic wedge-shaped charge directly into this gap, heading straight for Darius.
- For the second time, Darius fled. His flight once again caused the collapse of his army.

## Significance
- The battle was a total victory for Alexander and resulted in the complete rout of the Achaemenid army.
- Darius fled east, his authority as Great King shattered. He would be assassinated by his own satraps a year later.
- The victory opened the heart of the Persian Empire—Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis—to Alexander. He was now the undisputed ruler of Asia.
