# Event - Death of Cleitus the Black (328 BC)

A dark and pivotal episode that took place in Maracanda (Samarkand). During a drunken banquet, Alexander killed Cleitus the Black, the man who had saved his life at the [[Event - Battle of the Granicus (334 BC)]].

## The Confrontation
The argument erupted from a combination of factors:
- **Flattery:** Courtiers were flattering Alexander, comparing him to gods and belittling his father, [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]].
- **Macedonian Resentment:** Cleitus, a veteran of the old guard, was angered by this and by Alexander's increasing adoption of Persian customs ([[Topic - Policy of Fusion (Medism)|Medism]]).
- **Drunkenness:** Both men were heavily intoxicated.

Cleitus praised Philip's achievements and reminded Alexander that it was the blood and wounds of Macedonians that had won his empire. He culminated by referencing his own role in saving Alexander's life at the Granicus.

> [!quote] Cleitus's Words (from Plutarch)
> "Yet this cowardice of mine has already saved you, son of a God though you are, when you turned your back on the sword of Spithridates, and you have become so powerful through the blood and wounds of Macedonians that you deny Philip was your father and make yourself the son of Ammon."

## The Murder
Enraged, Alexander called for his guards. When Cleitus was hustled out, he re-entered through another door, shouting a defiant line from Euripides. Alexander seized a spear from a guard and ran Cleitus through, killing him instantly.

## Aftermath
Alexander was immediately overcome with remorse. He shut himself in his tent for days, refusing to eat or drink, and had to be consoled by his friends and philosophers.

> [!quote] Arrian's Judgment
> "For my part, I firmly place the blame on Cleitus for his insolence towards his king; I feel pity for Alexander for his misfortune, because at that time he showed that he was controlled by two vices, anger and drunkenness – a sensible man should not be mastered by either of them."
