# Event - Assassination of Philip II (336 BC)

The assassination of [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]] at Aegae was the catalyst for Alexander's accession to the throne. The event is shrouded in conspiracy and intrigue.

## The Official Account
The accepted killer was Pausanias of Orestis, a member of Philip's own bodyguard. The motive, according to Diodorus Siculus, was a personal grievance.
- Pausanias had been sexually assaulted by Attalus, a prominent general and uncle to Philip's new wife, Cleopatra Eurydice.
- When Pausanias sought justice, Philip failed to punish Attalus, instead promoting him.
- Seeking revenge, Pausanias stabbed Philip to death during the wedding celebrations of Philip's daughter.

## Theories of Conspiracy
Few ancient or modern historians believe Pausanias acted alone. The assassination was too convenient for too many people.
