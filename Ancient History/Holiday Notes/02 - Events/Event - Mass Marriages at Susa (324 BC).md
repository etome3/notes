# Event - Mass Marriages at Susa (324 BC)

In a grand ceremony at the city of Susa, Alexander and about 80-90 of his senior commanders and companions simultaneously married noble Persian and Median women. This was the culmination of his [[Topic - Policy of Fusion (Medism)|policy of fusion]].

## The Ceremony
- The weddings were conducted according to Persian custom.
- Alexander himself took two more wives: Stateira (a daughter of [[Person - Darius III]]) and Parysatis (a daughter of a previous Persian king). He was already married to Roxane.
- His closest friend, [[Person - Hephaestion]], married Drypetis, another daughter of Darius, so that their children would be cousins.
- Alexander also gave dowries to all the Macedonian soldiers (estimated at over 10,000) who had already married Asian women.

> "He also held weddings at Susa for himself and his companions. He himself married Barsine, the eldest of the daughters of Darius... To Hephaestion he gave Drypetis, another daughter of Darius and the sister of his own wife. For he wanted Hephaestion's children to be cousins to his own."

## Purpose and Significance
- **Political Fusion:** The primary goal was to create a new, unified Greco-Persian ruling class to govern the empire. It was a powerful symbolic and practical act of statecraft.
- **Legitimacy:** By marrying into the Achaemenid royal family, Alexander further legitimized his own position as the successor to the Persian kings.
- **Macedonian Reaction:** The event was met with resentment by many ordinary Macedonian soldiers, who saw it as another step in Alexander's abandonment of their traditions in favor of "barbarian" customs. This resentment contributed to the mutiny at Opis shortly after.
