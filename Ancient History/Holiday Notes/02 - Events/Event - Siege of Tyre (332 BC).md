# Event - Siege of Tyre (332 BC)

One of the most difficult and impressive military engineering feats of Alexander's career. The siege of the island-fortress of Tyre lasted for seven months.

## The Challenge
Tyre was located on an island about half a mile from the coast and was protected by formidable walls and a powerful navy. They refused to submit to Alexander, confident in their defenses.

## The Siege
- Alexander's engineers began constructing a causeway (a mole) across the sea to the island.
- The Tyrians repeatedly attacked the construction work with ships and fire.
- Alexander responded by building siege towers on the mole and assembling his own fleet from other Phoenician cities that had surrendered.
- After months of work and naval battles, the Macedonians finally breached the walls.

## The Aftermath
Alexander's retribution for the long and costly siege was brutal, in line with his policy of [[Topic - Military Genius and Strategy|precautionary ferocity]].
