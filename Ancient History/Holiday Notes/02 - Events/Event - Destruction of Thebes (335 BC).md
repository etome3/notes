# Event - Destruction of Thebes (335 BC)

Following a rumor of Alexander's death, the city of Thebes rose in rebellion against Macedonian rule. Alexander's response was swift and brutal, serving as a terrifying example to the rest of Greece.

## The Rebellion
- Thebes, a major Greek power, had been chafing under the Macedonian garrison installed by [[Person - Philip II of Macedon]].
- Believing Alexander was dead, they besieged the garrison and called for a Greek uprising.

## The Retribution
Alexander marched his army south with incredible speed. After a brief siege, the Macedonians stormed the city.
- The city was razed to the ground, with the exception of temples and the house of the poet Pindar.
- All male survivors were killed.
- Approximately 30,000 women and children were sold into slavery.
