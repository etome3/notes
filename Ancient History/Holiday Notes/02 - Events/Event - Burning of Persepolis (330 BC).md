# Event - Burning of Persepolis (330 BC)

After the victory at [[Event - Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC)|Gaugamela]], Alexander marched to Persepolis, the ceremonial and spiritual heart of the Achaemenid Empire. In a controversial act, he ordered the magnificent royal palace to be burned to the ground.

## The Act
The sources are divided on the motive for the destruction.
- **A Deliberate Act of Policy:** Arrian claims it was a calculated act of revenge for the Persian burning of Athens in 480 BC, symbolizing the end of the Panhellenic war of vengeance.
- **A Drunken Accident:** Plutarch offers a more dramatic story, claiming the idea came from Thaïs, an Athenian courtesan, during a drunken party. She suggested the women following the army should burn the palace to avenge Greece, and a drunken Alexander led the procession to light the fire.

> "She said that it would be an even greater pleasure to go for fun to set fire to the house of the Xerxes who had burned Athens. She wanted to light the fire herself with Alexander watching, so that it would be said that the women following Alexander's army had given a greater punishment to the Persians on behalf of Greece than all the famous commanders on sea and land."
