# Event - Proskynesis Affair (327 BC)

A major cultural and political crisis that arose from Alexander's attempt to introduce the Persian court ritual of *proskynesis* to his Macedonian and Greek followers.

## The Ritual
*Proskynesis* was the traditional Persian act of deference to a social superior, which involved bowing or full prostration before the king. To the Persians, this was a sign of respect for the office of the Great King. To the Greeks, however, prostration was an act reserved exclusively for the gods.

## The Attempt
- Alexander, as part of his [[Topic - Policy of Fusion (Medism)|policy of fusion]] and his growing belief in his own divinity, arranged with his flatterers to introduce the custom at a banquet.
- The plan was for the guests to drink from a golden cup, perform proskynesis, and then receive a kiss from the king.
- The Persians and some Macedonians complied.

## The Opposition
The court historian, Callisthenes (a nephew of [[Person - Aristotle]]), openly opposed the move. He argued that it was improper to conflate the honors due to gods with those due to men.

Callisthenes pointedly drank from the cup but did not perform proskynesis, and Alexander refused him the kiss.

## Significance
- The affair was a major failure for Alexander and he was forced to drop the issue for his European followers.
- It starkly highlighted the cultural clash between Greek/Macedonian traditions and Persian absolutism.
- It sealed the fate of Callisthenes, who was later implicated in a conspiracy and executed, further souring Alexander's relationship with philosophers and traditionalists.
