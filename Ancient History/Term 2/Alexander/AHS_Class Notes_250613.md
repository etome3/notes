- Ms K has sent through a reading for today’s lesson…
- What two words are used to define Alexander’s attitude towards conquering the world? -> ‘**precautionary ferocity**’
- Ferocious meaning -> savage, think of lions and tigers, brutal
- Precautionary meaning -> kill first, ask questions later
- Read Diodorus’ account of Philip’s assassination.
- Recap from last lesson - Pausanias (old) and Pausanius (young)
- Who wrote about Alexander and who used who? (physical hand out) – ask Ms K for a copy next week.
- How did the assassin kill Philip II? -> Celtic dagger
- What happened to the assassin -> he tripped, fell and was ultimately stabbed to death by Leonnatus. Perdiccas and Attalus
- Perdiccas becomes very influential in Alexander’s life.
- Watch a clip from the film _Alexander_ – what did the film’s director, Oliver Stone, get right about the account of the assassination and what does he add?
- Now, you need to think about what Alexander got from Philip’s estate/legacy…
- This was completed in groups (then presented to the class):

1. Argue that Philip’s legacy was rich
2. Argue that Philip’s legacy could not account for his son’s later success.
3. Explain how precautious ferocity worked – read DOWN (blue text).

*Make sure you write approx. 3 dot points for 1 and 2 for Monday’s lesson (use the sources from page 1-2 of Ms K’s handout).
