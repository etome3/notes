The most significant three learnings about Alexander the Great gleaned from Plutarch about the Battle of Gaugamela were:
1. Alexander’s immense self-belief and drive for glory over material wealth. An example of this is the story about the mock battle between two groups of soldiers, one led by a soldier named ‘Alexander’ and the other ‘Darius’. Alexander arranged for the two leaders to engage in single combat, with the ‘Alexander’ winning. This event was seen by the army as a positive omen for the upcoming battle.
2. Alexander was a leader who led from the front and was not afraid to take risks. Plutarch portrays him as a commander who personally led the charge that shattered the Persian lines. He was also decisive, rejecting his general Parmenio’s advice to attack at night. This confidence and decisiveness inspired his men to victory despite being heavily outnumbered.
3. Plutarch’s account, while not a purely military one, reveals Alexander’s tactical acumen. He emphasises that Alexander’s victory was due to superior tactics, not just brute force. His meticulous preparation for battle is also detailed, from his choice of armour to his consideration for his horse, Bucephalus.
