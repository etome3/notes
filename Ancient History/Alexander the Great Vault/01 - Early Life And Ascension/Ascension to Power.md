# Alexander's Ascension to Power

## Assassination of Philip II

In **336 BCE**, **Philip II**, Alexander's father and the King of Macedon, was assassinated by his bodyguard, Pausanias, at Aegae during the wedding celebration of his daughter Cleopatra. The motives behind the assassination remain debated by historians, with theories ranging from personal grievances to conspiracies involving Olympias (Alexander's mother), Alexander himself, or even the Persian Empire.

## Securing the Macedonian Throne

Upon Philip's death, Alexander, then 20 years old, swiftly moved to secure his claim to the throne. He was immediately proclaimed king by the Macedonian army and nobility, largely due to the support of influential generals like **Antipater**.

To eliminate potential rivals and consolidate his position, Alexander executed several individuals who posed a threat to his rule, including:

*   **Amyntas IV**: Philip II's nephew and a former king.
*   **Attalus**: A prominent general and uncle of Cleopatra, Philip's new wife, whose children could have challenged Alexander's legitimacy.

These decisive actions demonstrated Alexander's ruthlessness and determination to maintain control, sending a clear message to any who might question his authority.
