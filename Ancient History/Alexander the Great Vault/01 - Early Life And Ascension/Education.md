# Education of Alexander the Great

## Tutelage under Aristotle

From the age of 13 to 16, Alexander was tutored by the renowned Greek philosopher **Aristotle** in the city of Mieza. This period was profoundly influential on Alexander's intellectual development. Aristotle provided instruction in a wide range of subjects, including:

*   **Philosophy**: Ethics, politics, and metaphysics.
*   **Medicine**: Understanding of the human body and health.
*   **Science**: Biology, zoology, and botany.
*   **Rhetoric and Logic**: Skills crucial for leadership and persuasion.
*   **Literature**: Deep study of Greek classics, particularly Homer.

Aristotle's teachings instilled in Alexander a lifelong appreciation for Greek culture, a curiosity about the natural world, and a pragmatic approach to governance. The philosopher's emphasis on observation and reason likely contributed to Alexander's strategic thinking and administrative policies. [[05 - Key Figures/Aristotle|Aristotle]]

## Influence of Homeric Epics

A significant part of Alexander's education, both under Aristotle and independently, involved the study of **Homer's *Iliad*** and *Odyssey*. Alexander was particularly fascinated by the hero **Achilles**, whom he considered his ancestor through his mother, Olympias. He reportedly carried a copy of the *Iliad* (annotated by Aristotle) with him throughout his campaigns.

The heroic ideals, military prowess, and concepts of glory and destiny portrayed in Homer's epics deeply resonated with Alexander and are believed to have fueled his ambition for conquest and his desire to emulate legendary heroes.
