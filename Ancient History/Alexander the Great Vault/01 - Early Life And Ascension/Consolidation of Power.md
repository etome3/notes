# Consolidation of Power

After securing the Macedonian throne, Alexander faced immediate challenges to his authority from various Greek city-states and northern tribes who saw Philip II's death as an opportunity to regain independence.

## Suppression of Revolts

Alexander swiftly responded to these uprisings, demonstrating his military prowess and decisive leadership:

*   **Thebes (335 BCE)**: A major revolt erupted in Thebes, a powerful Greek city-state. Alexander marched his army south with incredible speed, catching the rebels by surprise. After a brief siege, Thebes was brutally sacked and destroyed, with its inhabitants enslaved. This act served as a stark warning to other Greek cities contemplating rebellion, effectively quashing any further widespread resistance. The destruction of Thebes solidified Macedonian dominance over Greece.

## Campaigns in the Balkans

Before embarking on his grand campaign against Persia, Alexander undertook a series of campaigns in the Balkans to secure Macedon's northern borders and assert his authority over the tribal peoples there.

*   **Triballian Campaign**: Alexander led his forces against the Triballi, a powerful Thracian tribe, defeating them in a series of engagements.
*   **Illyrian Campaign**: He then turned his attention to the Illyrians, who were also in revolt, subduing them and securing the western frontier.

These campaigns were crucial for:
*   **Securing his rear**: Ensuring no threats to Macedon while he was campaigning in Asia.
*   **Training his army**: Providing valuable combat experience for his troops and commanders.
*   **Demonstrating his leadership**: Proving himself a capable military commander in his own right, distinct from his father.

By the end of 335 BCE, Alexander had firmly established his control over Greece and Macedon, setting the stage for his ambitious invasion of the Persian Empire.
