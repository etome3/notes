Alexander's lineage was significant, as it connected him to both mythical heroes and powerful royal houses, bolstering his legitimacy and future ambitions.

## Macedonian Context

Macedon, located north of classical Greece, was a kingdom with a distinct culture and political structure. By the time of Alexander's birth, Philip II had already begun to centralize power, modernize the Macedonian army (introducing the **Macedonian phalanx**), and expand Macedonian influence throughout the Greek city-states.

Alexander grew up in a court steeped in military tradition and political intrigue, witnessing firsthand his father's strategic genius and the complexities of Greek politics. This environment undoubtedly shaped his early understanding of warfare, leadership, and governance.
