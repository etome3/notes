# The Lost Histories: Eyewitness Accounts of Alexander

While our main surviving narratives of Alexander the Great were written centuries after his death, they were all based on a rich collection of histories and memoirs written by men who actually accompanied him on his campaigns. These original, contemporary works are now almost entirely lost, but they form the bedrock of everything we know about Alexander. Understanding who wrote them and what their perspectives might have been is crucial for evaluating the sources we do have.

## Key Lost Works

1.  **The Histories of Callisthenes of Olynthus**:
    *   **Author**: Alexander's official court historian and the great-nephew of his former tutor, Aristotle.
    *   **Perspective**: Initially, his work was likely a glorifying, pro-Macedonian account of the expedition. However, Callisthenes's relationship with Alexander soured dramatically. He opposed the introduction of *proskynesis* (the Persian court ritual of prostrating oneself) and was later implicated in the "Pages' Conspiracy" and executed.
    *   **Significance**: His account would have been the official, "in-the-moment" version of events, at least for the early part of the campaign. His later opposition and death mean his work may have become more critical, or at least been viewed with suspicion by later pro-Alexander sources like Ptolemy.

2.  **The Memoirs of Ptolemy I Soter**:
    *   **Author**: One of Alexander's most trusted generals and a close childhood friend. After Alexander's death, he seized control of Egypt and founded the Ptolemaic dynasty.
    *   **Perspective**: Written late in his life, Ptolemy's account is considered a key source for Arrian. It is generally seen as a sober, military-focused narrative. However, it likely glorified both Alexander's achievements and his own role in them, perhaps downplaying the contributions of his rivals among the successors.
    *   **Significance**: As a king and a general, his work carried immense authority and heavily influenced the "official" military tradition of Alexander's story.

3.  **The Account of Aristobulus of Cassandreia**:
    *   **Author**: A Greek engineer and architect who served on the campaign.
    *   **Perspective**: Also a major source for Arrian. Aristobulus wrote his account in his old age. He is often seen as a more neutral and technical writer, but he had a tendency to flatter Alexander and sometimes included fantastical or exaggerated details, particularly regarding the geography and wonders of the East.
    *   **Significance**: He provides a different "on-the-ground" perspective from Ptolemy, perhaps focusing more on logistics, construction, and the novelties of the conquered lands.

4.  **The *Indica* of Nearchus**:
    *   **Author**: The admiral of Alexander's fleet, responsible for the perilous naval expedition from the Indus River back to the Persian Gulf.
    *   **Perspective**: His work, the *Indica*, focused specifically on this voyage. It was a detailed report on the geography, peoples, and natural wonders of the coast. Arrian preserved a large part of this work by incorporating it into his own *Indica*.
    *   **Significance**: It is our most important source for understanding the exploration aspect of Alexander's campaigns and the regions of the Indian Ocean as the Greeks first encountered them.

5.  **The History of Cleitarchus**:
    *   **Author**: A Greek historian who was likely a contemporary but probably not an eyewitness to the main campaign, possibly living in Alexandria in the late 4th or early 3rd century BCE.
    *   **Perspective**: Cleitarchus's work was incredibly popular in antiquity and is thought to be the main source for Diodorus Siculus and Quintus Curtius Rufus. He was known for his sensational, dramatic, and rhetorical style, often including lurid details and romanticized stories.
    *   **Significance**: He represents the "vulgate" or popular tradition of Alexander's story, which was more focused on entertainment and moralizing than the strict military and political history of the Ptolemaic tradition.

The existence of these lost works explains the different "flavors" we find in our surviving sources. Arrian represents the more "official" military and administrative history, while Diodorus and Curtius Rufus reflect the more colorful and dramatic "vulgate" tradition.
