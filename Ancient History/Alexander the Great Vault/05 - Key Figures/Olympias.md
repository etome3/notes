# Olympias (c. 375-316 BCE)

**Olympias** was the fourth wife of King **Philip II of Macedon** and the mother of **Alexander the Great**. A princess of Epirus, she was a formidable and influential figure in the Macedonian court, known for her strong will, ambition, and fervent devotion to mystical cults.

## Background and Marriage to Philip II

Olympias was the daughter of Neoptolemus I, King of Epirus. Her marriage to Philip II in 357 BCE was a political alliance, cementing ties between Macedon and Epirus. She gave birth to Alexander in 356 BCE.

## Relationship with Philip II

Their marriage was often tumultuous. Olympias was fiercely protective of Alexander's claim to the throne and resented Philip's numerous other marriages and relationships. Her rivalry with Philip's last wife, Cleopatra (niece of Attalus), was particularly intense, as Cleopatra's potential male offspring could have challenged Alexander's succession.

## Influence on Alexander

Olympias exerted a significant influence on Alexander, particularly in his early life. She fostered his belief in his divine lineage, claiming he was the son of Zeus, and encouraged his emulation of mythical heroes like Achilles (from whom she claimed descent). This instilled in Alexander a sense of destiny and exceptionalism.

## Role After Philip's Death

Following Philip II's assassination in 336 BCE, Olympias is suspected by some ancient sources of having played a role in his death, though there is no definitive proof. She certainly benefited from it, as it cleared the path for Alexander's immediate ascension to the throne. She then ruthlessly eliminated potential rivals, including Cleopatra and her infant child, to secure Alexander's position.

## Later Life and Death

During Alexander's long campaigns in Asia, Olympias remained in Macedon, often clashing with **Antipater**, the regent Alexander had appointed. After Alexander's death, she became deeply involved in the Wars of the Diadochi, fiercely defending the interests of her grandson, Alexander IV. She eventually returned to Macedon, where she executed Philip III Arrhidaeus (Alexander's half-brother) and his wife Eurydice. However, she was later besieged by Cassander, one of the Diadochi, and eventually executed in 316 BCE.

Olympias remains a controversial figure, but her powerful personality and unwavering support for Alexander were undeniable factors in his rise to power. [[Early Life|Early Life]]
