# Darius III (c. 380-330 BCE)

**Darius III** was the last king of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, reigning from 336 BCE to 330 BCE. He inherited a vast but increasingly decentralized empire and faced the formidable challenge of **Alexander the Great's** invasion.

## Accession to the Throne

Born Artashata, he was a distant relative of the royal family. He rose through the ranks of the Persian administration, eventually becoming a royal courier and then a satrap. He ascended to the throne in 336 BCE after the assassination of Artaxerxes IV, adopting the regnal name Darius III. His reign began in the same year that Alexander became King of Macedon.

## Confrontation with Alexander

Darius III's reign was dominated by the conflict with Alexander. Despite commanding immense resources and vast armies, he suffered a series of devastating defeats:

*   **Battle of Issus (333 BCE)**: This was the first direct confrontation between Darius and Alexander. Despite numerical superiority, Darius's army was routed due to the constricted terrain and Alexander's tactical brilliance. Darius himself fled the battlefield, abandoning his family, who were subsequently captured by Alexander. [[02 - Military Campaigns/Battle of Issus|Battle of Issus]]
*   **Battle of Gaugamela (331 BCE)**: Darius assembled an even larger army on a wide plain, hoping to negate Alexander's tactical advantages. However, Alexander's strategic maneuvers and a decisive charge into the Persian center again forced Darius to flee, leading to the complete collapse of the Persian army. This battle effectively marked the end of the Achaemenid Empire. [[02 - Military Campaigns/Battle of Gaugamela|Battle of Gaugamela]]

## Flight and Assassination

After Gaugamela, Darius became a fugitive. He attempted to raise new forces in the eastern satrapies but was increasingly losing authority. In **330 BCE**, he was betrayed and assassinated by his own satrap, **Bessus**, who declared himself Artaxerxes V. Bessus hoped to gain favor with Alexander or continue resistance, but Alexander pursued and eventually executed Bessus for his treachery.

## Legacy

Darius III is often portrayed as an ineffective ruler and military commander in comparison to Alexander. However, he inherited an empire already facing internal weaknesses and was confronted by an unprecedented military genius. His reign marked the end of a glorious Persian dynasty that had lasted over two centuries, paving the way for the Hellenistic Age.
