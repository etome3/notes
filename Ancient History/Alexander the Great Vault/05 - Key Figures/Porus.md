# Porus (fl. 4th Century BCE)

**Porus** (or Puru) was the ruler of the Pauravas, an ancient kingdom located between the Hydaspes (Jhelum) and Acesines (Chenab) rivers in the Punjab region of ancient India. He is primarily known for his courageous stand against **Alexander the Great** at the **Battle of Hydaspes**.

## Battle of Hydaspes (326 BCE)

In 326 BCE, Alexander's army encountered Porus's forces on the banks of the Hydaspes River. Porus commanded a formidable army that included a large contingent of **war elephants**, a weapon the Macedonians had not faced on such a scale before.

*   **Strategic Position**: Porus positioned his army to defend the river crossing, anticipating Alexander's movements.
*   **Elephant Warfare**: He deployed his elephants as a front line, intending to break the Macedonian phalanx and cause chaos.
*   **Courageous Leadership**: Despite Alexander's brilliant river crossing and tactical maneuvers, Porus fought bravely and led his forces with distinction. Even after his elephants were routed and his army encircled, he refused to flee.

## Aftermath and Legacy

Alexander, deeply impressed by Porus's valor and dignity in defeat, asked him how he wished to be treated. Porus famously replied, "Treat me, O Alexander, as a king." Alexander not only allowed Porus to continue ruling his kingdom but also expanded his territory, making him a satrap loyal to the Macedonian crown.

Porus's resistance, though ultimately unsuccessful, highlighted the challenges Alexander faced in India and the limits of his army's endurance. His story is a testament to the fierce independence of some Indian rulers and Alexander's pragmatic approach to governance, recognizing and rewarding merit even in an adversary.

The encounter with Porus and the subsequent mutiny at the Hyphasis River marked the turning point of Alexander's eastern campaigns, leading to his decision to return westward. [[02 - Military Campaigns/Battle of Hydaspes|Battle of Hydaspes]]
