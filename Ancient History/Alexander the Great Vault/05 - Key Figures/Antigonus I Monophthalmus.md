# Antigonus I Monophthalmus (c. 382-301 BCE)

**Antigonus I Monophthalmus** ("the One-Eyed") was one of Alexander the Great's most powerful and ambitious generals, and a key figure in the [[04 - Death & Legacy/Successor Kingdoms (Diadochi)|Wars of the Diadochi]]. He came closer than any other to reuniting Alexander's empire under his own rule.

## Companion of Alexander

Antigonus was an older and experienced general who served Philip II and later Alexander. He was appointed satrap of Phrygia in Asia Minor after Alexander's initial conquests. Unlike many of the younger generals, he did not accompany Alexander on his eastern campaigns beyond Persia, remaining in Asia Minor to secure the conquered territories.

## Rise as a Diadoch

Upon Alexander's [[04 - Death & Legacy/Death of Alexander|death]] in 323 BCE, Antigonus quickly emerged as a dominant force.

*   **Consolidation in Asia Minor**: He skillfully consolidated his power in Asia Minor, defeating rivals and expanding his influence.
*   **Conflict with Perdiccas**: He initially allied with Antipater against Perdiccas, Alexander's regent, playing a crucial role in the First War of the Diadochi.
*   **Ambition to Reunite the Empire**: Antigonus harbored the ambition to reunite Alexander's empire under his sole rule. He engaged in extensive military campaigns against other Diadochi, including Ptolemy, Seleucus, and Lysimachus.
*   **Declaration of Kingship**: In 306 BCE, after his son Demetrius Poliorcetes' naval victory at Salamis (Cyprus), Antigonus declared himself king, a move soon emulated by the other Diadochi.

## Battle of Ipsus (301 BCE)

Antigonus's relentless expansion and ambition led to the formation of a grand coalition against him, comprising Seleucus, Lysimachus, and Cassander. The decisive confrontation occurred at the **Battle of Ipsus** in Phrygia.

*   **Forces**: Antigonus and Demetrius commanded a large army, but the coalition forces, particularly Seleucus's war elephants, proved superior.
*   **Outcome**: Antigonus, at the age of 81, was killed in battle, and his army was decisively defeated. This battle marked the end of any serious attempt to restore Alexander's unified empire.

## Legacy

Antigonus I Monophthalmus was a brilliant military strategist and a formidable political operator. Although he failed to achieve his ultimate goal of reuniting the empire, his efforts profoundly shaped the Hellenistic world. His dynasty, the **Antigonids**, eventually secured control of Macedon and parts of Greece, becoming one of the three major Hellenistic kingdoms.
