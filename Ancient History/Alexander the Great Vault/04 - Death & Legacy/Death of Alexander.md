# Death of Alexander the Great (323 BCE)

**Alexander the Great** died in **Babylon** on **June 10, 323 BCE**, at the age of 32. The circumstances surrounding his death remain one of the most debated and mysterious events in ancient history, with various theories proposed by ancient and modern historians.

## Circumstances and Theories

Alexander's final days were marked by a fever that progressively worsened. Ancient accounts describe him suffering from intense thirst and delirium.

*   **Natural Causes**: The most widely accepted theory is that Alexander died of natural causes, likely a disease exacerbated by his strenuous campaigns, numerous wounds, and heavy drinking. Possible diseases include:
    *   **Typhoid Fever**: A common and often fatal illness in the ancient world, consistent with his symptoms.
    *   **Malaria**: Also prevalent in the region.
    *   **West Nile Virus**: A more recent theory, though less evidence.
    *   **Pancreatitis**: Caused by excessive alcohol consumption.

*   **Poisoning**: This theory gained traction in antiquity and persists today, though it lacks definitive proof.
    *   **Suspects**: Various individuals have been implicated, including his generals (Diadochi), his wife Roxane, or even **Aristotle** (through his nephew Callisthenes, who was executed by Alexander).
    *   **Motive**: The desire of his generals to gain power, or resentment over his increasingly autocratic and "Oriental" behavior.
    *   **Evidence**: Ancient sources like Diodorus Siculus and Justin mention rumors of poisoning, but these are often sensationalized and lack concrete evidence. The slow onset of symptoms also makes poisoning less likely, as most ancient poisons acted quickly.

## Succession Crisis

Alexander's death triggered an immediate and prolonged **succession crisis**. He had not named a clear successor, and when asked on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his empire, he reportedly replied, "To the strongest" (or "to the best").

*   **No Clear Heir**: His wife Roxane was pregnant, but the child (Alexander IV) was born after his death. His half-brother, Philip III Arrhidaeus, was mentally incapacitated.
*   **Generals' Ambitions**: Alexander's leading generals, the **Diadochi** (meaning "Successors"), immediately began vying for control of the vast empire. These included:

    *   [[05 - Key Figures/Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus I Monophthalmus]]
    *   Craterus, Perdiccas, Lysimachus, Cassander, and Eumenes.

The lack of a designated heir and the ambitions of his powerful generals led to decades of conflict known as the **Wars of the Diadochi**, which ultimately resulted in the fragmentation of Alexander's empire into several independent Hellenistic kingdoms.
