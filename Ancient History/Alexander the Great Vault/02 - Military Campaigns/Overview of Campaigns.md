# Overview of Alexander's Military Campaigns

Alexander the Great's military campaigns represent one of the most ambitious and successful series of conquests in ancient history. Spanning over a decade, his expeditions led to the downfall of the Achaemenid Persian Empire and the creation of an empire stretching from Greece to India.

## Strategic Goals and Military Innovations

Alexander's campaigns were driven by a combination of factors:

*   **Revenge for Persian Invasions**: A stated goal was to avenge the Persian invasions of Greece in the 5th century BCE.
*   **Personal Ambition and Glory**: Alexander sought to emulate mythical heroes like Achilles and achieve unparalleled glory.
*   **Expansion of Macedonian Power**: Building upon his father Philip II's achievements, Alexander aimed to extend Macedonian hegemony.
*   **Economic Gain**: The vast wealth of the Persian Empire was a significant lure.

His military success was largely due to:

*   **Macedonian Phalanx**: A highly disciplined and effective infantry formation, armed with the *sarissa* (long pike).
*   **Companion Cavalry**: Elite heavy cavalry, often led by Alexander himself, used for decisive charges.
*   **Combined Arms Tactics**: Effective coordination between infantry, cavalry, archers, and siege engineers.
*   **Logistical Prowess**: Ability to move and supply large armies across vast and challenging terrains.
*   **Adaptability**: Willingness to adapt tactics to different enemies and environments.
*   **Personal Leadership**: Alexander's presence on the battlefield, often fighting at the front, inspired his troops.

## Overview of the Persian Empire

At the time of Alexander's invasion, the **Achaemenid Persian Empire** was the largest empire the world had yet seen, stretching from Egypt to India. Ruled by **Darius III**, it possessed immense resources and a vast army, though its military organization and leadership were often less cohesive than Alexander's forces. The empire's decentralized nature and reliance on satrapies (provinces) with varying loyalties would prove to be both a strength and a weakness against Alexander's unified command.
