# Battle of Gaugamela (331 BCE)

The **Battle of Gaugamela** was the decisive confrontation between Alexander the Great and **Darius III**, fought on **October 1, 331 BCE**, near modern-day Mosul, Iraq. This monumental victory effectively marked the end of the Achaemenid Persian Empire and solidified Alexander's position as the "King of Asia."

## Forces Involved

*   **Macedonian Army**: Estimated around 47,000 men, including the Macedonian phalanx, Companion Cavalry, light infantry, and allied Greek forces. Led by **Alexander the Great**.
*   **Persian Army**: Ancient sources claim numbers as high as a million, but modern estimates range from 100,000 to 250,000. It included a vast array of imperial levies, elite Persian cavalry, Greek mercenaries, and new elements like scythed chariots and war elephants. Commanded by [[Darius III]].

## Terrain and Persian Preparations

Darius chose a wide, open plain near Gaugamela, allowing him to deploy his numerically superior forces to their full advantage, unlike the constricted terrain at Issus. He also had the ground leveled to maximize the effectiveness of his scythed chariots.

## Key Maneuvers and Outcome

The battle was a masterpiece of tactical deception and execution by Alexander.

1.  **Alexander's Oblique Advance**: Alexander advanced his army in an oblique formation, extending his right flank far to the right, drawing the Persian cavalry wide.
2.  **The "Porthole" Maneuver**: As the Persian cavalry on Darius's left flank pursued Alexander's extended right, a gap (or "porthole") opened in the Persian center.
3.  **Companion Cavalry Charge**: Alexander, seizing the moment, led his Companion Cavalry directly into this gap, aiming straight for Darius's position.
4.  **Phalanx Engagement**: The Macedonian phalanx engaged the main Persian infantry line, holding their ground despite fierce resistance.
5.  **Darius's Second Flight**: Faced with Alexander's direct charge and the collapse of his center, Darius III once again fled the battlefield, abandoning his army.
6.  **Persian Rout**: Darius's flight triggered a complete collapse of the Persian lines. Despite a desperate counter-attack on the Macedonian left by some Persian and Indian cavalry, the battle was effectively over.

The Battle of Gaugamela was a crushing defeat for the Persian Empire. Alexander's victory was total, leading to the capture of major Persian capitals like Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis. Darius III became a fugitive and was later assassinated by his own satrap, Bessus, effectively ending the Achaemenid dynasty. This battle cemented Alexander's reputation as one of history's greatest military commanders.
