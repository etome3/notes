# Alexander's Campaigns in India (327-326 BCE)

After consolidating his control over the former Persian Empire, Alexander the Great turned his attention eastward, embarking on campaigns into the Indian subcontinent. This phase of his conquests was marked by challenging terrain, fierce resistance, and ultimately, the limits of his army's endurance.

## Advance into India

Alexander's forces crossed the Hindu Kush mountains in 327 BCE, entering the region of Gandhara (modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan). He aimed to conquer the "ends of the world" and reach the mythical Eastern Ocean.

*   **Siege of Aornos**: One of the most difficult sieges, Alexander captured the formidable rock fortress of Aornos, a feat even Heracles was said to have failed.
*   **Alliances and Conflicts**: Alexander formed alliances with some local rulers, such as Taxiles of Taxila, but faced strong opposition from others, most notably **King Porus** of the Pauravas.

## Battle of Hydaspes

The most significant engagement in India was the [[02 - Military Campaigns/Battle of Hydaspes|Battle of Hydaspes]] (326 BCE) against King Porus. This battle was notable for:

*   **War Elephants**: The Macedonians encountered war elephants for the first time on a large scale, posing a significant challenge.
*   **Tactical Brilliance**: Alexander's strategic river crossing and combined arms tactics ultimately secured a hard-won victory.
*   **Respect for Porus**: Impressed by Porus's bravery and leadership, Alexander allowed him to continue ruling his kingdom as a satrap.

## Mutiny at the Hyphasis River

Despite his victories, Alexander's army was exhausted and demoralized. They had been campaigning for nearly a decade, were far from home, and faced the prospect of confronting even larger and more powerful Indian kingdoms beyond the Hyphasis River (modern-day Beas River).

In **326 BCE**, the Macedonian troops, led by **Coenus**, mutinied at the Hyphasis. They refused to advance further, demanding to return home. Alexander, after three days of seclusion and realizing the futility of forcing his weary men, reluctantly agreed to turn back. This marked the easternmost extent of his conquests.

## Return Journey

The return journey was arduous and costly. Alexander divided his forces:

*   **Land Route**: A portion of the army, led by Craterus, marched through the Bolan Pass.
*   **Naval Expedition**: Alexander himself led a fleet down the Hydaspes and Indus rivers to the Indian Ocean, exploring the coast. This journey through the Gedrosian Desert was particularly brutal, resulting in heavy losses due to heat, thirst, and starvation.

The Indian campaigns, while extending Alexander's empire to its greatest geographical extent, also highlighted the limits of his army's endurance and the immense logistical challenges of maintaining such a vast dominion.
