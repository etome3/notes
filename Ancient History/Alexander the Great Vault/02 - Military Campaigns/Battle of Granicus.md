# Battle of Granicus (334 BCE)

The **Battle of Granicus** was the first major engagement between Alexander's Macedonian army and the forces of the Persian Empire, fought in **May 334 BCE** near the Granicus River (modern-day Biga Çayı in Turkey). This victory opened the path for Alexander's conquest of Asia Minor.

## Forces Involved

*   **Macedonian Army**: Approximately 35,000-40,000 men, including the elite **Companion Cavalry**, Macedonian phalanx, and various allied Greek and Thracian troops. Led by **Alexander the Great**.
*   **Persian Forces**: Composed primarily of Greek mercenaries (estimated 10,000-12,000) and Persian cavalry (estimated 10,000-15,000). Commanded by several Persian satraps and generals, including **Memnon of Rhodes**, a skilled Greek mercenary commander.

## Key Maneuvers and Outcome

The battle took place on the eastern bank of the Granicus River. The Persians positioned their cavalry along the riverbank, intending to use the river as a defensive barrier, with the Greek mercenaries behind them on higher ground.

Alexander, despite advice to wait, launched an immediate and audacious attack.

1.  **Cavalry Charge**: Alexander led his Companion Cavalry across the river, directly engaging the Persian cavalry. This was a high-risk maneuver, as they were vulnerable while crossing.
2.  **Phalanx Advance**: The Macedonian phalanx followed, crossing the river and forming up to support the cavalry.
3.  **Alexander's Personal Valor**: Alexander himself fought fiercely, reportedly having his helmet struck by an axe and being saved by Cleitus the Black. His presence at the front lines inspired his troops.
4.  **Persian Collapse**: The Persian cavalry, despite initial resistance, were eventually overwhelmed by the coordinated Macedonian attack. Many Persian commanders were killed.
5.  **Mercenary Slaughter**: The Greek mercenaries in Persian service, left exposed after the cavalry fled, were largely surrounded and massacred by Alexander's forces.

The Battle of Granicus was a decisive Macedonian victory. It demonstrated Alexander's tactical brilliance and personal courage, securing his initial foothold in Asia Minor and severely weakening Persian resistance in the region. It also sent a clear message to the Greek city-states in Asia Minor that Alexander was a formidable liberator.
