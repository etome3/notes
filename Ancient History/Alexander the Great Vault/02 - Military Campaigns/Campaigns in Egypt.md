# Alexander's Campaigns in Egypt (332-331 BCE)

Following the arduous [[02 - Military Campaigns/Siege of Tyre|Siege of Tyre]], Alexander the Great continued his march south into Egypt. Unlike the fierce resistance encountered in the Levant, Egypt largely welcomed Alexander as a liberator from Persian rule.

## Arrival and Welcome

The Persian satrap of Egypt, Mazaces, offered little resistance. The Egyptians, who had long resented Persian domination, viewed Alexander as a deliverer and a fulfillment of ancient prophecies. He was welcomed as a pharaoh and a divine figure, a stark contrast to the oppressive Persian regime.

## Founding of Alexandria

In **331 BCE**, Alexander founded the city of **Alexandria** on the Mediterranean coast, at the western edge of the Nile Delta. This was one of many cities he would found across his empire, but Alexandria in Egypt would become the most famous and enduring.

*   **Strategic Location**: Chosen for its excellent harbor, defensible position, and access to both the Mediterranean Sea and the Nile River, making it ideal for trade and naval operations.
*   **Urban Planning**: Alexander commissioned the Greek architect Dinocrates to design the city, laying out a grid plan that would become a model for Hellenistic urban centers.
*   **Cultural Significance**: Alexandria quickly grew into a major center of Hellenistic culture, learning, and commerce, eventually housing the famous Library of Alexandria and the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos).

## Visit to Siwa Oasis

Alexander made a significant journey to the **Siwa Oasis** in the Libyan Desert to consult the oracle of **Amun**. The oracle reportedly confirmed his divine parentage, declaring him the son of Zeus-Ammon. This pronouncement had profound implications for Alexander's self-perception and his image among his troops and the conquered peoples, reinforcing his claims to divine right and universal kingship.

## Departure for Mesopotamia

After consolidating his control over Egypt and establishing Alexandria, Alexander left a Macedonian governor in charge and prepared for his decisive confrontation with Darius III in Mesopotamia, which would culminate in the [[02 - Military Campaigns/Battle of Gaugamela|Battle of Gaugamela]]. His time in Egypt was relatively peaceful and highly productive, allowing him to solidify his image as a legitimate ruler and establish a lasting monument in Alexandria.
