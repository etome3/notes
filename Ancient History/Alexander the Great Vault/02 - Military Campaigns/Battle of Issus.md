## Strategic Significance and Terrain

Darius III, confident in his numerical superiority, marched his vast army to cut off Alexander's supply lines. Alexander, initially moving south, turned back to confront Darius. The battle took place on a narrow coastal plain, bordered by mountains on one side and the sea on the other. This constricted terrain negated the Persian numerical advantage, preventing Darius from deploying his full force effectively.

## Key Maneuvers and Outcome

1.  **Alexander's Flanking Maneuver**: Alexander personally led his Companion Cavalry on the right flank, charging directly towards Darius's position in the center.
2.  **Phalanx Advance**: The Macedonian phalanx advanced steadily, engaging the Persian infantry in the center.
3.  **Persian Counter-Attack**: The Persian cavalry on Darius's right flank initially gained some ground against the Macedonian left, but were eventually repelled.
4.  **Darius's Flight**: As Alexander's cavalry broke through the Persian left and threatened Darius's personal guard, the Persian king panicked and fled the battlefield in his chariot. His flight caused a general rout of the Persian army.
5.  **Capture of Royal Family**: Darius's mother, wife, and children were captured by Alexander's forces, a significant propaganda victory for the Macedonians.

The Battle of Issus was a stunning victory for Alexander. It demonstrated his tactical genius in utilizing terrain to his advantage and his unwavering resolve in directly confronting the enemy king. Darius's flight severely damaged his authority and morale among his troops, paving the way for Alexander's further conquests in the Levant and Egypt.
