# Battle of Hydaspes (326 BCE)

The **Battle of Hydaspes** was fought in **326 BCE** on the banks of the Hydaspes River (modern-day Jhelum River in Pakistan) between Alexander the Great and **King Porus** of the Pauravas kingdom. It was Alexander's last major battle and one of his most challenging, showcasing his adaptability against a new and formidable enemy: war elephants.

## Forces Involved

*   **Macedonian Army**: Estimated around 30,000-40,000 infantry and 5,000-7,000 cavalry. Led by **Alexander the Great**.
*   **Pauravas Army**: Estimated around 20,000-50,000 infantry, 2,000-4,000 cavalry, 1,000 chariots, and crucially, 85-200 **war elephants**. Commanded by **King Porus**. [[Porus]]

## Challenges in India

Alexander's campaign in India presented unique challenges:
*   **Monsoon Season**: Heavy rains and swollen rivers made movement difficult.
*   **New Terrain**: Dense forests and unfamiliar landscapes.
*   **War Elephants**: A formidable psychological and physical weapon previously unseen by the Macedonians.
*   **Fierce Resistance**: Indian kingdoms, though fragmented, offered strong opposition.

## Key Maneuvers and Outcome

Porus positioned his army behind the Hydaspes River, anticipating Alexander's crossing. Alexander employed a brilliant deception to cross the river undetected.

1.  **Deceptive Movements**: Alexander conducted numerous feigned crossing attempts over several nights, habituating Porus's forces to his movements.
2.  **Secret Crossing**: Under the cover of a stormy night, Alexander led a significant portion of his army (including Companion Cavalry and elite infantry) several miles upstream and crossed the river at a less guarded point.
3.  **Cavalry Flank Attack**: After crossing, Alexander's cavalry quickly engaged Porus's cavalry, drawing them away from the elephants.
4.  **Elephant Charge and Macedonian Response**: Porus launched his war elephants against the Macedonian phalanx. The Macedonians, trained to deal with elephants, used their *sarissas* to wound the elephants and target their mahouts. They also employed tactics to open their ranks, allowing the elephants to pass through, then attacking them from the flanks and rear.
5.  **Encirclement**: As the elephants caused chaos and the Indian infantry struggled against the phalanx, Alexander's cavalry, having routed Porus's cavalry, encircled the Indian army.

The battle was a hard-fought victory for Alexander. Despite heavy casualties, the Macedonians ultimately prevailed due to their superior tactics, discipline, and Alexander's leadership. Alexander, impressed by Porus's bravery, allowed him to continue ruling his kingdom as a satrap.

The Battle of Hydaspes marked the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests. Shortly after, his weary troops, facing further formidable Indian kingdoms and the onset of the monsoon, mutinied at the Hyphasis River, forcing Alexander to turn back.
