# Siege of Tyre (332 BCE)

The **Siege of Tyre** was a monumental and arduous military operation conducted by Alexander the Great from **January to July 332 BCE**. It demonstrated Alexander's engineering prowess and relentless determination in the face of formidable resistance.

## Background

After his victory at the [[02 - Military Campaigns/Battle of Issus|Battle of Issus]], Alexander marched south along the Mediterranean coast. Most cities surrendered peacefully, but the island city of Tyre, a wealthy Phoenician stronghold, refused him entry and allegiance. Tyre was strategically important as a naval base and a symbol of resistance.

## The Island City's Defenses

Tyre was located on an island approximately half a mile from the mainland, protected by massive walls up to 150 feet high on the seaward side. Its powerful navy controlled the seas, making a direct assault extremely difficult.

## Alexander's Engineering Feat: The Mole

Alexander decided to build a **mole** (a causeway or land bridge) connecting the mainland to the island. This was an unprecedented engineering undertaking:

*   **Construction**: Thousands of soldiers and local laborers were employed to build the mole, using rubble, timber, and earth.
*   **Challenges**: The Tyrians constantly harassed the construction with naval attacks, archers, and even fire ships. The mole also faced challenges from strong currents and deep water as it approached the island.
*   **Naval Blockade**: To counter Tyre's navy, Alexander assembled his own fleet, drawing ships from allied Phoenician cities (which had defected from Persia), Cyprus, and Rhodes. This fleet eventually blockaded Tyre, preventing supplies and reinforcements from reaching the island.

## The Final Assault

Once the mole reached the city walls and Alexander's fleet had secured naval superiority, the final assault began:

*   **Siege Engines**: Alexander deployed massive siege towers and battering rams on the mole and on ships.
*   **Breach**: After relentless bombardment, a breach was finally made in the southern wall of the city.
*   **Storming the City**: Macedonian forces, led by Alexander, stormed the city through the breach and from ships.

## Outcome

The Siege of Tyre ended in a brutal Macedonian victory. The city was sacked, and its inhabitants were either killed or enslaved. The fall of Tyre was a crucial step in Alexander's conquest of the Levant, securing his rear and denying the Persian navy vital bases before his advance into Egypt. It also served as a grim warning to any other cities considering resistance.
