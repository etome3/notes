**Bond Type Determination**

Use the information in the data and bond type table to identify the type of bond in each of the following substances.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Substance**|**Type of bonds**|
|NaCl|Ionic|
|Sugar (sucrose)|Covalent|
|Copper|Metallic|
|Unknown 1|Ionic|
|Unknown 2|Covalent|
|Unknown 3|Metallic|
|Unknown 4|Covalent|

**Unknown Identification**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Unknown**|**Formula**|
|Unknown 1|CaCl2|
|Unknown 2|C (must be diamond)|
|Unknown 3|Hg|
|Unknown 4|C10H8|

**6.** **Inferring Unknown Identities** The four unknowns have the following chemical formulas: C, C10H8, CaCl2, and Hg. Can you assign the correct formula to each unknown in the ‚ÄúUnknown Identification‚Äù table, using your observations of the properties of the unknowns and what you know about bonds and the periodic table?

**7.** **Evaluating Methods** What information from this lab helped you identify the unknowns? Explain how this information helped you reach conclusions about the identities of the unknowns.

|   |
|---|
|Observations of properties helped identify the bond types.<br><br>Bond types helped identify unknowns.<br><br>Unknown 1 ü°™ ionic bond (so metal and non-metal) ü°™ CaCl2<br><br>Unknown 2 ü°™ covalent bond, very high MP, must be covalent giant network ü°™ C (must be diamond form rather than graphite)<br><br>Unknown 3 ü°™ metallic bond ü°™ Hg<br><br>Unknown 4 ü°™ covalent bond, low MP, must be covalent simple molecular ü°™ C10H8|

**8.** **Evaluating Methods** Your results for Unknowns 2 and 3 may not have been quite as clear-cut as the results for other substances. Now that you‚Äôve made a conclusion about their identities, are you surprised that the bond types for these substances were not easily classified? Explain your answer.

|   |
|---|
|As Unknown 2 is a covalent giant network, it is difficult to classify this as a high MP can sometimes mislead to an ionic compound identification, but it should not conduct electricity. However, some covalent giants can such as C (graphite).<br><br>Unknown 3 is challenging, as it‚Äôs the only metal that naturally exists in liquid form. Most metal properties relate to their solid form, so it can be a challenge to identify Hg as a metal.|

**9.** **Making Inferences** Carbon, C, is an element that can take several different forms. The most common forms are graphite, the substance found in pencils and referred to as ‚Äúpencil lead,‚Äù and diamond. Based on the properties you observed in the virtual lab, which form of carbon was one of the unknowns? Explain the evidence that supports your inference.

|   |
|---|
|It is diamond. Graphite conducts well, diamond doesn‚Äôt. Diamond is shiny and transparent.|

**Bonding and Properties ‚Äì Part 2**

Analyse the information in the table below to identify the most likely type of bonding for each substance. Justify your choices using evidence from the table.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Substance|Type of bonding|Phase at room temp.|Hardness|Melting point (‚ó¶C)|Electrical conductivity without water|Electrical conductivity Dissolved (or melted)|Solubility in water (does it dissolve)|
|A|Covalent|Liquid|n/a|0|No|No|n/a|
|B|ionic|solid|brittle|808|no|Yes|yes|
|C|ionic|Solid|brittle|680|No|yes|Yes|
|D|covalent|solid|hard|186|No|no|yes|
|E|covalent|liquid|n/a|-6|No|no|no|
|F|metallic|solid|Hard, malleable|1085|yes|yes|No|
|G|covalent|liquid|n/a|-114|No|no|yes|
|H|covalent|solid|hard|Decomposes at high temp|No|no|no|
|I|Covalent network|solid|Very hard|4000|No|no|no|
|J|covalent|Liquid|n/a|18|No|No|no|
|K|ionic|solid|brittle|772|No|yes|yes|
|L|Covalent network|solid|Soft, greasy|4000|yes|yes|no|

Note: L may have been interpreted as metallic due to solid, high melting point and able to conduct electricity as both solid and liquid.

Justifications should use evidence about hardness (being brittle or hard) for ionic or covalent, low melting points for covalent, high melting points for covalent network, high melting points for ionic and metallic and electrical conductivity as solid for metallic and liquid for ionic.
