# Proposed Changes for Chemistry

The current structure of the Chemistry folder is organized by term. To unify the structure with the `Ancient History/Holiday Notes` folder, the following changes are proposed:

*   **Create a main "Map of Content" (MOC) file:** This file, named `MOC - Chemistry.md`, will serve as a central hub for all topics related to Chemistry.
*   **Create new folders for note categories:**
    *   `00 - MOCs`
    *   `01 - Topics`
    *   `02 - Labs`
    *   `03 - Concepts`
    *   `04 - Laws`
    *   `05 - Compounds`
*   **Move existing notes:** The notes currently in `Term 1`, `Term 2`, and `Term 3` should be moved to the appropriate new folders. The `Chemistry Vault` should also be reviewed and its contents moved to the appropriate new folders.
*   **The existing `Attachments` folder can be used for all attachments.**
*   **Rename `Chemistry.md` to `00 - Chemistry MOC.md` and move it to `00 - MOCs`**
*   **The `space` folder can remain as is.**
