## **Pressure**
- Pressure is a measure of force per unit area
- For a *gas*, pressure is a measure of the average number of collisions per unit time

The SI unit for pressure is **Pascals (Pa)**
1 Pa = 1 N/m^2^
###### *Other units for pressure:*
**Kilopascals (kPa)**
- 1 kPa = 1000 Pa
**Atmospheres (atm)**
- 1 atm = 101.3 kPa
**Millimetres of Mercury (mmHg)**
- 1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa
- 1 kPa = 7.5 mmHg
## **Ideal Gases**
Used as a simplified model to predict the behaviour of gases.
*Behaviour of real gases is complicated.*
The ideal gas assumptions are suitable for modelling gases at higher temperatures and lower pressures.
Model starts to fail at low temperatures and at high pressures.
###### *Ideal Gases - Assumptions:*
1) All gas molecules display the same behaviour. No differences arise from different molecules / chemical nature (i.e. O2, H2, Cl2, and CO2 gas would all display the same behaviour).
2) Gas molecules do not interact with each other – intermolecular forces are negligible.
3) The volume of gas particles is negligible compared to the volume taken up by the gas. 
## **Kinetic Theory of Gases**
1. **A gas consists of small particles (atoms or molecules) that move randomly with rapid velocities.** Gas molecules moving in all directions at high speeds cause a gas to fill the entire volume of a container. 
2. **Intermolecular forces between gas particles are negligible.** Gas particles move far apart and will expand to fill a container of any size and shape.
3. **The actual volume occupied by gas molecules is very small.** Most of the volume of a gas is empty space, which allows gases to be compressed.
4. **The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature (in Kelvin).**  Gas particles move faster as the temperature increases, hitting the walls of the container with more force and producing higher pressures. 
5. **Gas particles move in straight paths until colliding with other gas particles or with the walls of the container to bounce off *elastically* in other directions.**  An increase in either the frequency or force of collisions against the walls of the container causes an increase in the **gas pressure.**
## **Ideal Gases - Conditions**
**Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)**
- STP = 273 K (0oC) and 100 kPa, 22.4 L/mol

**Standard Laboratory Conditions (SLC)**
- SLC = 298 K and 100 kPa, 24.8 L/mol

**Room Temperature and Pressure (RTP)**
- RTP = 298 K and 1 atm, 24.0 L/mol
## **Boyle’s Law**
Inverse relationship between volume and pressure.
As volume increases, pressure decreases.
*When temperature and moles are constant.*
V~1~P~1~ = V~2~P~2~

## **Charles’ Law**
Proportional relationship between temperature and volume.
As temperature increases, volume also increases.

## **Avogadro’s Law**

## **Ideal Gas Law**

$\Large{\text{PV}=\text{nRT}}$
**Where:**
$\text{P}$ = Pressure (kPa)
$\text{V}$ = Volume (L)
$\text{n}$ = number of moles (mol)
$\text{R}$ = Ideal gas constant 8.314 J/K/mol
$\text{T}$ = Temperature (K)
###### *Ideal Gas Law - Alternative ‘R’ Constant:*
* Important point is to make sure that your units are consistent.
You may also see the ideal gas constant R = 0.082 L atm / K / mol
If you use this gas constant, you need:
P = Pressure (atm)
V = Volume (L)
n = moles (mol)
R = 0.082 L .atm/K/mol
T = temperature (K)
