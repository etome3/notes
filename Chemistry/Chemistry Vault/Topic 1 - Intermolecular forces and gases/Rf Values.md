## Calculating and Interpreting Rf Values

The retention factor (Rf) is a dimensionless quantity used in chromatography to help identify compounds. It represents the ratio of the distance traveled by a particular component to the distance traveled by the solvent front.

### Calculation

The Rf value is calculated using the following formula:

$$ Rf = \frac{\text{distance traveled by the component}}{\text{distance traveled by the solvent front}} $$

- The distances are typically measured from the origin line (where the sample was initially spotted).

### Interpretation

- **Range:** The Rf value will always be between 0 and 1.
- **Identification:** Under the same conditions (stationary phase, mobile phase, temperature), a specific compound will always have the same Rf value. This allows for the identification of unknown substances by comparing their Rf values to those of known standards.
- **Polarity:**
    - A lower Rf value indicates a stronger attraction to the stationary phase and a lower attraction to the mobile phase. This is typical of more polar compounds in normal-phase chromatography.
    - A higher Rf value indicates a weaker attraction to the stationary phase and a stronger attraction to the mobile phase. This is typical of less polar compounds.
