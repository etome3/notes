## Principles of Chromatography

Chromatography is a laboratory technique used to separate the components of a mixture. The separation is based on the differential distribution of the components between two phases: a stationary phase and a mobile phase.

### Key Components

- **Stationary Phase:** A solid or a liquid supported on a solid. It does not move.
- **Mobile Phase:** A liquid or a gas that flows through the stationary phase, carrying the components of the mixture with it.

### How it Works

Components that have a stronger interaction with the stationary phase will move more slowly, while components with a stronger interaction with the mobile phase will move more quickly. This difference in movement causes the components to separate.

## Types of Chromatography

### 1. Paper Chromatography

- **Stationary Phase:** A strip of absorbent paper (cellulose).
- **Mobile Phase:** A solvent.
- **Use:** To separate mixtures of colored substances, like inks or plant pigments.

### 2. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)

- **Stationary Phase:** A thin layer of an adsorbent material (like silica gel or alumina) coated onto a flat, inert substrate (like glass or plastic).
- **Mobile Phase:** A solvent.
- **Use:** Similar to paper chromatography, but often provides faster and more clear-cut separations.

### [[Rf Values]]

The retention factor (Rf) is a quantitative measure of a component's movement in chromatography. It is calculated as:

$$ Rf = \frac{\text{distance traveled by the component}}{\text{distance traveled by the solvent front}} $$
