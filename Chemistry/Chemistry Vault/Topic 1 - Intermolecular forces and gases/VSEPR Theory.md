## Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory

The VSEPR theory is a model used to predict the 3D geometry of individual molecules from the number of electron pairs surrounding their central atoms. The theory is based on the principle that valence electrons around a central atom will arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible to minimize electrostatic repulsion.

### Key Principles

1.  **Electron Groups:** Electron groups can be single bonds, double bonds, triple bonds, or lone pairs of electrons.
2.  **Repulsion:** The repulsion between electron groups determines the overall shape of the molecule.
3.  **Hierarchy of Repulsion:**
    - Lone pair-lone pair repulsion is the strongest.
    - Lone pair-bonding pair repulsion is intermediate.
    - Bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion is the weakest.
