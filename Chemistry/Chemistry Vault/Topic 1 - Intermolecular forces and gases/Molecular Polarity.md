## Determining Molecular Polarity

Molecular polarity is a measure of the unequal distribution of electron density within a molecule. A molecule's polarity is determined by both the polarity of its individual bonds and its overall molecular geometry.

### Key Factors

1.  **Electronegativity Difference:**
    - A bond is considered polar if there is a significant difference in the electronegativity of the bonded atoms.
    - The greater the difference, the more polar the bond.

2.  **Molecular Shape (Symmetry):**
    - A molecule can have polar bonds but be nonpolar overall if its shape is symmetrical, causing the bond dipoles to cancel each other out.
    - Asymmetrical molecules with polar bonds will be polar.

### Examples

- **CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide):** Linear shape. The two C=O bond dipoles are equal and opposite, so they cancel out. The molecule is **nonpolar**.
- **H₂O (Water):** Bent shape. The two O-H bond dipoles do not cancel out. The molecule is **polar**.
- **CCl₄ (Carbon Tetrachloride):** Tetrahedral shape. The four C-Cl bond dipoles cancel out. The molecule is **nonpolar**.
- **CHCl₃ (Chloroform):** Tetrahedral shape. The C-H and C-Cl bond dipoles do not cancel out. The molecule is **polar**.
