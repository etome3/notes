### Key Points

- **Chemical Analysis:** Modern society relies heavily on chemical analysis to identify substances, determine their purity, and understand their composition. Techniques like [[Chromatography Techniques|chromatography]] are essential in fields ranging from forensics to environmental monitoring.

- **SCUBA Diving:** The development of SCUBA (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus) by Jacques Cousteau and Emile Gagnan was a landmark achievement that required a deep understanding of the behavior of [[Gases]] under pressure.

- **Molecular Modeling:** Chemists have developed sophisticated two- and three-dimensional models to represent and communicate the shapes of molecules. These models, based on theories like [[VSEPR Theory]], are crucial tools for understanding and predicting chemical reactions.

- **Limitations of Theories:** It is important to recognize that scientific theories, like [[VSEPR Theory]], have their limitations and are constantly being refined as new evidence becomes available.
