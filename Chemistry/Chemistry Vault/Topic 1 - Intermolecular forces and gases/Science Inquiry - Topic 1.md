### Investigations

- **Boyle's Law:** Investigate the inverse relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas at constant temperature.

- **Molar Volume of a Gas:** Experimentally determine the volume of one mole of a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

- **Chromatography:**
    - **Paper Chromatography:** Separate the components of a mixture (e.g., ink) using paper as the stationary phase.
    - **Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC):** Use TLC to separate a mixture and calculate the [[Rf Values]] for the components.

- **3D Molecular Models:**
    - Construct physical or virtual 3D models of linear, bent, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, and trigonal pyramidal molecules to visualize their shapes and bond angles.
    - Use simulations to explore the predictions of [[VSEPR Theory]].
