## Types of Intermolecular Forces (IMFs)

Intermolecular forces are the attractions or repulsions between neighboring molecules. These forces are much weaker than the intramolecular forces (covalent bonds) that hold atoms together within a molecule, but they are crucial for determining the physical properties of substances.

### 1. Dispersion Forces (London Dispersion Forces)

- **Description:** The weakest type of IMF, present in all molecules. They arise from temporary, instantaneous dipoles that occur due to the random movement of electrons.
- **Strength:** Increases with the number of electrons and the surface area of the molecule.

### 2. Dipole-Dipole Attractions

- **Description:** Occur between polar molecules. The positive end of one molecule is attracted to the negative end of another.
- **Strength:** Stronger than dispersion forces for molecules of similar size.

### 3. Hydrogen Bonding

- **Description:** A special, stronger type of dipole-dipole attraction. It occurs when hydrogen is bonded to a highly electronegative atom (N, O, or F).
- **Strength:** The strongest type of IMF.

### Influence on Physical Properties

The strength of intermolecular forces has a significant impact on a substance's physical properties:

- **[[Vapor Pressure]]**: Stronger IMFs lead to lower vapor pressure because it is more difficult for molecules to escape into the gas phase.
- **[[Melting and Boiling Points]]**: Stronger IMFs require more energy to overcome, resulting in higher melting and boiling points.
- **[[Solubility]]**: "Like dissolves like." Polar substances tend to dissolve in polar solvents, and nonpolar substances dissolve in nonpolar solvents. This is due to the similar intermolecular forces between the solute and solvent molecules.
