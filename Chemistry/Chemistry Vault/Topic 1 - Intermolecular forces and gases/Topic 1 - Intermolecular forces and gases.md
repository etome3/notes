## Core Concepts

### [[Intermolecular Forces]]
- **[[VSEPR Theory]]**: Understanding and predicting the three-dimensional shapes of molecules.
- **[[Molecular Polarity]]**: Determining the polarity of molecules based on their geometry and electronegativity differences.
- **[[Influence on Physical Properties]]**: Exploring how intermolecular forces affect vapor pressure, melting point, boiling point, and solubility.

### [[Chromatography Techniques]]
- **[[Paper and Thin Layer Chromatography]]**: Techniques for separating and identifying components of a mixture.
- **[[Rf Values]]**: Calculating and interpreting retention factors in chromatography.

### [[Gases]]
- **[[Gas Laws]]**: Investigating the relationships between pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of a gas.
- **[[Kinetic Theory of Gases]]**: A model to explain the macroscopic properties of gases.
- **[[Ideal Gas Law]]**: Applying the ideal gas equation (PV=nRT) to solve for unknown variables.
