## The Behavior of Gases

Gases are one of the four fundamental states of matter. They are characterized by their low density, high compressibility, and ability to fill any container they occupy. The behavior of gases can be described by a set of laws and a theoretical model.

### Key Concepts

- **[[Gas Laws]]**: A set of empirically derived laws that describe the relationships between the pressure, volume, temperature, and amount (moles) of a gas.
    - **[[Boyle's Law]]**: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂ (at constant temperature and moles)
    - **[[Charles's Law]]**: V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂ (at constant pressure and moles)
    - **[[Avogadro's Law]]**: V₁/n₁ = V₂/n₂ (at constant pressure and temperature)

- **[[Kinetic Theory of Gases]]**: A model that explains the macroscopic properties of gases by considering the motion of their constituent particles.

- **[[Ideal Gas Law]]**: A single equation that combines the gas laws and describes the state of a hypothetical ideal gas.
    - **Formula:** PV = nRT

- **Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP):**
    - **Temperature:** 0°C or 273.15 K
    - **Pressure:** 1 atm
    - At STP, one mole of an ideal gas occupies a volume of 22.4 L.
