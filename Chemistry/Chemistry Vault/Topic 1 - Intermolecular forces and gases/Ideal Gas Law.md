## The Ideal Gas Equation

The ideal gas law is a fundamental equation that relates the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of an ideal gas.

---

### The Formula

$$ PV = nRT $$

Where:
- **P** = Pressure (in atmospheres, atm)
- **V** = Volume (in liters, L)
- **n** = Number of moles
- **R** = Ideal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)
- **T** = Temperature (in Kelvin, K)

---

### Applications

The ideal gas law can be used to:

- Calculate the value of any one of the four variables (P, V, n, T) if the other three are known.
- Determine the molar mass of a gas.
- Calculate the density of a gas.
- Solve stoichiometry problems involving gases.

### Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)

- **Conditions:** 0°C (273.15 K) and 1 atm.
- **Molar Volume at STP:** At STP, one mole of any ideal gas has a volume of 22.4 L.
