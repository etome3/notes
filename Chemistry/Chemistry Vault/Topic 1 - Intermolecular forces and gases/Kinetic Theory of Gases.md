## The Kinetic-Molecular Theory of Gases

The kinetic theory of gases provides a model to explain the behavior of ideal gases. It is based on a set of assumptions about the nature of gas particles.

### Postulates of the Kinetic Theory

1.  **Particle Size:** Gas particles are so small compared to the distances between them that their volume is considered negligible.
2.  **Constant Motion:** Gas particles are in constant, random, straight-line motion.
3.  **No Intermolecular Forces:** There are no attractive or repulsive forces between gas particles.
4.  **Elastic Collisions:** Collisions between gas particles and with the walls of the container are perfectly elastic (no kinetic energy is lost).
5.  **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** The average kinetic energy of the gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature (in Kelvin).

### Explaining Gas Behavior

- **Pressure:** Arises from the collisions of gas particles with the walls of the container.
- **Temperature:** A measure of the average kinetic energy of the gas particles. Higher temperature means higher average kinetic energy and faster-moving particles.
- **Volume:** The space that the gas particles occupy as they move around.

### Limitations

The kinetic theory of gases applies best to ideal gases at low pressures and high temperatures. It breaks down for real gases at high pressures and low temperatures, where the volume of the particles and the intermolecular forces between them become significant.
