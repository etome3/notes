### Key Points

- **Acid Rain:** The burning of fossil fuels releases sulfur dioxide (SOâ‚‚) into the atmosphere, which can lead to the formation of acid rain. Understanding the [[Reactions of Acids]] is crucial for mitigating the environmental impact of acid rain.

- **Blood Chemistry:** Blood plasma is a complex aqueous solution containing a variety of ions and molecules. The pH of blood is tightly regulated, and even small changes can have serious health consequences. The chemistry of blood also determines blood types.

- **Water Quality and Treatment:** The composition of water from different sources varies, and this knowledge is essential for treating water to make it safe for consumption. Water quality is assessed by measuring various properties, including pH and the concentration of dissolved ions.
