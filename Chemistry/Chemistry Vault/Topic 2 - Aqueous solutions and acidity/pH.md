## The Measure of Acidity and Alkalinity

pH is a measure of the hydrogen ion (H⁺) concentration in a solution. It is used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution.

### The pH Scale

The pH scale is a logarithmic scale that typically ranges from 0 to 14.

- **Acidic:** pH < 7
- **Neutral:** pH = 7
- **Basic (Alkaline):** pH > 7

Because the scale is logarithmic, a change of one pH unit represents a tenfold change in the H⁺ ion concentration.

### Calculation

The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration.

$$ \text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+] $$

### pOH

Similarly, pOH is a measure of the hydroxide ion (OH⁻) concentration.

$$ \text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH}^-] $$

In any aqueous solution at 25°C, the sum of the pH and pOH is 14.

$$ \text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14 $$
