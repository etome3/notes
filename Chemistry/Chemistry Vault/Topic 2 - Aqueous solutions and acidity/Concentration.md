## Measuring the Concentration of Solutions

Concentration is a measure of the amount of solute that is dissolved in a given quantity of solvent or solution. Square brackets, [ ], are often used to denote concentration.

### Molarity (M)

Molarity is the most common unit of concentration in chemistry. It is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.

### Formula

$$ \text{Molarity (c)} = \frac{\text{moles of solute (n)}}{\text{volume of solution (V in L)}} $$

---

### Calculations

The molarity formula can be rearranged to solve for any of the variables:

- **Moles of solute (n):** n = c Ã— V
- **Volume of solution (V):** V = n / c

---

### Example Calculation

**Question:** What is the molarity of a solution prepared by dissolving 0.5 moles of NaCl in enough water to make 2 L of solution?

**Solution:**

$$ c = \frac{0.5 \text{ mol}}{2 \text{ L}} = 0.25 \text{ M} $$
