## The Ability to Dissolve

Solubility is the maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature to form a saturated solution.

### Factors Affecting Solubility

Several factors can influence the solubility of a substance:

1.  **Nature of Solute and Solvent ("Like Dissolves Like"):**
    - Polar solutes tend to dissolve in polar solvents.
    - Nonpolar solutes tend to dissolve in nonpolar solvents.
    - This is due to the similar [[Intermolecular Forces]] between the solute and solvent molecules.

2.  **Temperature:**
    - **Solids:** The solubility of most solid solutes increases as the temperature of the solvent increases.
    - **Gases:** The solubility of gaseous solutes decreases as the temperature of the solvent increases.

3.  **Pressure (for gaseous solutes):**
    - The solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid (Henry's Law).

### [[Solubility Curves]]

A solubility curve is a graph that shows the solubility of a substance at different temperatures. These curves can be used to:

- Determine the solubility of a substance at a given temperature.
- Compare the solubilities of different substances.
- Determine whether a solution is unsaturated, saturated, or supersaturated.
