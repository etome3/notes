## Visualizing Solubility

A solubility curve is a graphical representation of the solubility of a substance over a range of temperatures. The y-axis typically represents the solubility (in grams of solute per 100 g of solvent), and the x-axis represents the temperature.

### Interpreting a Solubility Curve

- **On the line:** Any point on the curve represents a [[Solutions|saturated solution]].
- **Below the line:** Any point below the curve represents an [[Solutions|unsaturated solution]].
- **Above the line:** Any point above the curve represents a [[Solutions|supersaturated solution]].

### Using a Solubility Curve

Solubility curves can be used to:

1.  **Determine Solubility:** Find the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a specific temperature.
2.  **Predict Crystallization:** Determine how much solute will crystallize out of a solution when it is cooled.
3.  **Compare Solubilities:** Compare the solubilities of different substances at the same temperature.
