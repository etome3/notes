## The Basics of Solutions

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The components of a solution are the solute and the solvent.

### Key Terms

- **[[Solute]]**: The substance that is dissolved in a solution. It is typically present in a smaller amount.
- **[[Solvent]]**: The substance that dissolves the solute. It is typically present in a larger amount. When the solvent is water, the solution is called an aqueous solution.
- **[[Solution]]**: The homogeneous mixture of the solute and the solvent.

### Types of Solutions

Solutions can be classified based on the amount of solute they contain relative to the maximum amount they can dissolve at a given temperature.

- **[[Unsaturated Solution]]**: A solution that contains less solute than the maximum amount it can dissolve at a given temperature. More solute can still be dissolved.

- **[[Saturated Solution]]**: A solution that contains the maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved at a given temperature. If more solute is added, it will not dissolve.

- **[[Supersaturated Solution]]**: A solution that contains more solute than it can theoretically hold at a given temperature. These solutions are unstable, and the excess solute will crystallize out if the solution is disturbed.

### Concentration vs. Strength

- **[[Concentration]]**: Refers to the amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent or solution. It is a quantitative measure (e.g., molarity).
- **Strength**: In the context of acids and bases, strength refers to the degree to which an acid or base dissociates or ionizes in solution. A strong acid completely ionizes, while a weak acid only partially ionizes.
