### Investigations

- **Precipitation Reactions:**
    - Perform precipitation reactions to identify the presence of specific cations and anions in solution.
    - Use [[Solubility Rules]] to predict the products of precipitation reactions.

- **Factors Affecting Solubility:**
    - Investigate how temperature affects the solubility of a solid solute in water.
    - Design an experiment to explore other factors that affect solubility, such as the nature of the solvent or the particle size of the solute.

- **Reactions of Acids:**
    - Observe the reactions of acids with bases (neutralization), metals, and carbonates.
    - Write balanced chemical and ionic equations for these reactions.
