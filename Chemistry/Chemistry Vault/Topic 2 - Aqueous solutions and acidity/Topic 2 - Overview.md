## Core Concepts

### [[Aqueous Solutions and Molarity]]
- **[[Properties of Water]]**: Understanding the unique properties of water due to its molecular shape and hydrogen bonding.
- **[[Solutions]]**: Differentiating between solutes, solvents, and solutions, as well as unsaturated, saturated, and supersaturated solutions.
- **[[Concentration]]**: Calculating the concentration of a solution using the mole concept.

### [[Identifying Ions in Solution]]
- **[[Precipitation Reactions]]**: Writing ionic equations and using solubility rules to predict the formation of precipitates.
- **[[Identifying Specific Ions]]**: Using precipitation and acid-carbonate reactions to identify the presence of specific ions in solution.

### [[Solubility]]
- **[[Factors Affecting Solubility]]**: Investigating how temperature and the nature of the solute and solvent affect solubility.
- **[[Solubility Curves]]**: Analyzing and interpreting solubility curves.

### [[pH]]
- **[[The pH Scale]]**: Understanding the logarithmic nature of the pH scale and its relationship to the concentration of hydrogen ions.
- **[[Arrhenius Theory]]**: Applying the Arrhenius model to explain the behavior of strong and weak acids and bases.

### [[Reactions of Acids]]
- **[[Acid-Base Reactions]]**: Writing balanced equations for the reactions of acids with bases, metals, and carbonates.
