## General Rules for the Solubility of Ionic Compounds in Water

These rules are a set of guidelines that help predict whether an ionic compound will be soluble or insoluble in water at room temperature.

### Soluble Compounds

| Ion                                  | General Rule    | Exceptions                  |
| :----------------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Group 1 cations (Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, etc.) | Always soluble  | None                        |
| Ammonium (NH₄⁺)                      | Always soluble  | None                        |
| Nitrate (NO₃⁻)                       | Always soluble  | None                        |
| Acetate (CH₃COO⁻)                    | Always soluble  | None                        |
| Halides (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻)               | Usually soluble | Ag⁺, Pb²⁺, Hg₂²⁺            |
| Sulfate (SO₄²⁻)                      | Usually soluble | Ca²⁺, Sr²⁺, Ba²⁺, Pb²⁺, Ag⁺ |

### Insoluble Compounds

| Ion               | General Rule      | Exceptions                             |
| :---------------- | :---------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Carbonate (CO₃²⁻) | Usually insoluble | Group 1 cations, NH₄⁺                  |
| Phosphate (PO₄³⁻) | Usually insoluble | Group 1 cations, NH₄⁺                  |
| Sulfide (S²⁻)     | Usually insoluble | Group 1 cations, Group 2 cations, NH₄⁺ |
| Hydroxide (OH⁻)   | Usually insoluble | Group 1 cations, Ba²⁺, Sr²⁺, Ca²⁺      |
