## The Arrhenius Model of Acids and Bases

The Arrhenius theory, proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1884, was one of the earliest models to explain the behavior of acids and bases.

### Definitions

- **Arrhenius Acid:** A substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water.
    - Example: HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq)

- **Arrhenius Base:** A substance that increases the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH⁻) when dissolved in water.
    - Example: NaOH(s) → Na⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)

### Strong vs. Weak Acids and Bases

The Arrhenius model also helps to explain the difference between strong and weak acids and bases:

- **Strong Acids/Bases:** Completely ionize or dissociate in water, producing a high concentration of H⁺ or OH⁻ ions.
- **Weak Acids/Bases:** Only partially ionize in water, resulting in a lower concentration of H⁺ or OH⁻ ions.

### Limitations

The Arrhenius theory has some limitations:

- It only applies to aqueous solutions.
- It does not explain the basicity of substances that do not contain OH⁻, such as ammonia (NH₃).

More general theories, such as the Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis theories, have since been developed.
