## Formation of Precipitates

A precipitation reaction is a type of chemical reaction in which two soluble ionic compounds in aqueous solution react to form an insoluble solid product, called a precipitate.

### Predicting Precipitation

To predict whether a precipitate will form when two solutions are mixed, we can use a set of [[Solubility Rules]]. These rules provide guidelines for the solubility of common ionic compounds in water.

### Writing Equations

Precipitation reactions can be represented by three types of chemical equations:

1.  **Molecular Equation:** Shows the complete chemical formulas of all the reactants and products.
    - Example: AgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)

2.  **Complete Ionic Equation:** Shows all the strong electrolytes dissolved in the solution as their constituent ions.
    - Example: Ag⁺(aq) + NO₃⁻(aq) + Na⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s) + Na⁺(aq) + NO₃⁻(aq)

3.  **Net Ionic Equation:** Shows only the ions that are directly involved in the formation of the precipitate. Spectator ions (ions that do not participate in the reaction) are omitted.
    - Example: Ag⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) → AgCl(s)

### Identifying Ions

Precipitation reactions are a key tool for identifying the presence of specific ions in a solution. By adding a reagent that is known to form a precipitate with a particular ion, we can confirm the presence of that ion.
