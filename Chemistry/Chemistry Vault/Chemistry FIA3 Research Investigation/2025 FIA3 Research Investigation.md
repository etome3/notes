| **An example of how one of the claims could be developed into a research question**<br><br>**Claim:** Plastics are bad for the environment.<br><br>**Research question:** What effect do catalysts have on the chemical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by glycolysis?<br><br>**Developing the research question:**<br><br>1. Identify the key (important) terms in the claim.<br>    1. ‘plastics’, ‘bad’, ‘environment’<br>2. Propose refining questions that need to be addressed to refine key terms and narrow the focus of the claim.<br>    1. Which plastic will I investigate?<br>    2. Why did I choose this plastic?<br>    3. What do I mean by ‘bad’ for the environment in chemical terms?<br>3. Provide an example of how one of the claims could be developed into a research question. Conduct research to gather information to address the refining questions.<br>    1. The plastic that will be investigated is PET.<br>    2. PET’s structural and chemical properties make it a high-demand plastic that is not biodegradable. Therefore, it is an environment problem if not recycled.<br>    3. PET can be recycled by a chemical process called glycolysis, which requires a catalyst.<br>    4. Products from chemically recycling PET can be used as feedstock (raw materials) for other products.<br>4. Draft the research question to address the claim.<br>    1. How does chemically recycling PET help the environment?<br>5. Refine and focus the research question.<br>    1. How does chemically recycling PET by glycolysis help the environment?<br>    2. What factors affect the chemical recycling of PET by glycolysis?<br><br>Present the research question to the teacher for approval.<br><br>What effect do catalysts have on the chemical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by glycolysis?<br><br>**Note:** You cannot use this sample research question for your investigation. |                                                                            |              |                         |
