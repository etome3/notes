# Summary and Synthesis

## Research Question

> How does hydrogen bonding explain water’s unusually high surface tension compared to other liquids?

### Refinement Notes from [[Research Question]]:
- Consider rewording the start of the RQ to make it more open (e.g. "To what extent does...").
- Be more specific about 'other liquids'. What other liquids will you be comparing water to? What is the criteria for choosing these? (e.g. similar molecular weight).

## Rationale Core Idea

> Water's exceptionally high surface tension provides a distinct and measurable example of hydrogen bonding’s influence. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the powerful cohesive forces generated by water's extensive hydrogen-bonding network.
