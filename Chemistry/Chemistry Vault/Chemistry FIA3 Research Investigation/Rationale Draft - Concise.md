# # **Rationale**
Water's physical properties are highly anomalous for its small molecular size, exhibiting unusually high boiling points and surface tension crucial for biological and geochemical systems. This investigation evaluates the scientific claim that **“hydrogen bonding gives water unique properties”** by providing empirical evidence focused on surface tension, a direct and measurable consequence of these bonds.

Surface tension is the cohesive energy at a liquid's surface, resulting directly from intermolecular forces (IMFs). While most liquids are governed by weak dispersion or dipole-dipole forces, water is dominated by hydrogen bonds—an exceptionally strong and directional IMF. This extensive hydrogen-bonding network is theorised to cause water's high surface tension (Brini et al., 2017). Quantifying the surface tension of various liquids therefore allows for the relative strength of their IMFs to be inferred, providing a method to investigate the specific influence of hydrogen bonding.

This leads to the refined research question:
> [!question] **To what extent does hydrogen bonding contribute to water's anomalously high surface tension when compared to liquids with different dominant intermolecular forces?**

To isolate the effect of hydrogen bonding, this investigation will compare the surface tension of water with liquids where IMFs are systematically varied. This experiment will utilise a homologous series of primary alcohols (ethanol, propanol) and a nonpolar alkane (hexane).
*   **Water (H₂O):** Dominated by an extensive network of strong hydrogen bonds.
*   **Alcohols (Ethanol, Propanol):** Possess a hydroxyl (-OH) group for hydrogen bonding, but the increasing length of the nonpolar alkyl chain systematically increases the influence of weaker dispersion forces.
*   **Hexane (C₆H₁₄):** A nonpolar molecule exhibiting only London dispersion forces, providing a baseline for a liquid without hydrogen bonds.

By measuring the surface tension of these liquids, a trend correlating the prevalence of hydrogen bonding with surface tension can be established. It is hypothesised that water will exhibit the highest surface tension, followed by a decrease down the alcohol series (ethanol > propanol), with hexane displaying the lowest value. This result would provide quantitative evidence to evaluate the extent to which hydrogen bonding is responsible for water's uniquely high surface tension.
