# **Rationale**
This investigation will test the scientific claim that **“hydrogen bonding gives water unique properties.”** Hydrogen bonds are a special, strong type of attraction that occurs between water molecules. These bonds are much stronger than the intermolecular forces found in many other liquids, and they are responsible for many of water's unusual characteristics.

One of these key properties is water's very high surface tension. Surface tension is a measure of how strongly the molecules at a liquid's surface are pulled together. The powerful network of hydrogen bonds in water creates strong cohesive forces, resulting in a surface tension that is significantly higher than that of most other liquids. This makes surface tension an excellent and measurable property to investigate the effect of hydrogen bonding.

To test this, the surface tension of water will be measured and compared to other liquids that have different intermolecular forces. This experiment will use ethanol, propanol, and hexane. The alcohols (ethanol and propanol) also have hydrogen bonds due to their hydroxyl (-OH) group. By comparing the shorter alcohol (ethanol) to the longer one (propanol), we can see how the influence of hydrogen bonding changes as the nonpolar carbon chain gets bigger. Hexane, which is nonpolar and has only weak dispersion forces, will be used as a baseline to show the surface tension of a liquid with no hydrogen bonds.

The experiment will measure surface tension (dependent variable) for each of the different liquids (independent variable) under controlled conditions. It is hypothesised that water will show the highest surface tension, followed by ethanol and then propanol, with hexane having the lowest. This result would provide direct evidence that hydrogen bonding increases the surface tension of a liquid, supporting the initial claim.
