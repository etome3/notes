# **Rationale**
Water's role as the solvent for life is fundamental, yet its physical properties are highly anomalous. For a molecule with such a low molar mass, it exhibits an unusually high boiling point, heat capacity, and surface tension. These characteristics are pivotal to countless biological and geochemical systems. The scientific basis for this unique behaviour is captured in the claim that **“hydrogen bonding gives water unique properties.”** This investigation seeks to find empirical evidence to evaluate this claim by focusing on one of its most direct consequences: surface tension.

Surface tension is the macroscopic manifestation of the net cohesive energy at a liquid's surface, arising from intermolecular forces (IMFs). While all molecules experience weak London dispersion forces, polar molecules also exhibit stronger dipole-dipole interactions. Water, however, is dominated by hydrogen bonds—a particularly potent and directional form of dipole-dipole interaction occurring when hydrogen is bonded to a highly electronegative atom like oxygen. These bonds create a powerful, extensive network of attraction between water molecules (Brini et al., 2017). It is this network that is thought to be responsible for water's exceptionally high surface tension. By quantifying the surface tension of different liquids, the relative strength of their underlying intermolecular forces can be inferred. This provides a direct and measurable method to investigate the influence of hydrogen bonding.

This leads to the refined research question:
**To what extent does hydrogen bonding contribute to water's anomalously high surface tension when compared to liquids with different dominant intermolecular forces?**

### **Background**
To evaluate the contribution of hydrogen bonding, it is necessary to compare the surface tension of water with that of other liquids where the type and strength of IMFs can be systematically varied. Surface tension arises because molecules at the surface have fewer neighbouring molecules to attract them than molecules in the bulk liquid. This creates a net inward pull, minimising the surface area and creating cohesive energy at the surface. The magnitude of this energy, and thus the surface tension, is directly proportional to the strength of the IMFs present.

This investigation will utilise a homologous series of primary alcohols (ethanol and propanol) and a nonpolar alkane (hexane) to create a spectrum of intermolecular force profiles.
*   **Water (H₂O):** Each molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds, creating a uniquely strong and resilient three-dimensional network. Its forces are dominated by hydrogen bonding.
*   **Alcohols (e.g., Ethanol, Propanol):** These molecules possess a hydroxyl (-OH) group, enabling them to form hydrogen bonds. However, they also have nonpolar alkyl chains that only interact via weaker London dispersion forces. As the alkyl chain length increases from ethanol to propanol, the relative contribution of hydrogen bonding to the molecule's overall IMF profile decreases, while the contribution from dispersion forces increases.
*   **Hexane (C₆H₁₄):** As a nonpolar molecule, hexane is incapable of hydrogen bonding or significant dipole-dipole interactions. Its intermolecular forces are limited to London dispersion forces, providing a baseline measurement for a liquid without strong, directional bonds.

By measuring the surface tension of these selected liquids, a trend correlating the prevalence of hydrogen bonding with surface tension can be established. It is hypothesised that water will exhibit the highest surface tension, followed by a decrease down the alcohol series (ethanol > propanol), with hexane displaying the lowest value. Such a result would provide strong quantitative evidence to support the claim that hydrogen bonding is the primary factor responsible for water's uniquely high surface tension.
