# **Rationale**
Water's unique properties are fundamental to life on Earth and countless geochemical processes. This investigation seeks to evaluate the scientific claim that **“hydrogen bonding gives water unique properties.”** Hydrogen bonds are a particularly strong class of intermolecular force that form between a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom—such as oxygen in a water molecule—and a nearby electronegative atom. This force is significantly stronger than the dipole-dipole and London dispersion forces that govern the interactions of many other simple molecular compounds. As a result, water exhibits physical and chemical properties, such as a high boiling point and heat capacity, that are highly anomalous when compared to molecules of similar size and mass (Brini et al., 2017).

Among these anomalous properties, water's exceptionally high surface tension provides a distinct and measurable example of hydrogen bonding’s influence. Surface tension is a quantitative measure of the cohesive energy at a liquid’s surface, resulting from the net inward pull experienced by surface molecules from the bulk liquid. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the powerful cohesive forces generated by water's extensive hydrogen-bonding network. As noted by Gragson and Richmond (1998), "the strong hydrogen bonding between water molecules leads to... a relatively high surface tension," making it an excellent case study through which to evaluate the overarching claim.
