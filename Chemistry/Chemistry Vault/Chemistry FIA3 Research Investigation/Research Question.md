## <u>Order:</u>
1. Choosing claim
**Hydrogen bonding gives water unique properties.**
2. Finding data - 3 to 5 (3 for final)
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jp9806011

3. Develop <u>Research Question</u> (**rough**)
How does hydrogen bonding explain waterâ€™s unusually high surface tension compared to other liquids?

4. Draft <u>Rationale</u>
5. Refine <u>Research Question</u>
Maybe address strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding in water molecules, compare to other molecular liquids of similar molecular weight
Consider rewording start of RQ to make it more open.
e.g. To what extent does...
Be more specific about 'other liquids'. What other liquids will you be comparing water to? What is the criteria for choosing these? Similar molecular structure / atoms / etc?
