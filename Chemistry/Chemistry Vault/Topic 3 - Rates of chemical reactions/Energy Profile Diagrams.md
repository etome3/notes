## Visualizing the Energy Changes in a Reaction

An energy profile diagram is a graph that shows the change in potential energy of a system as a reaction proceeds. It provides a visual representation of the activation energy and the enthalpy change of a reaction.

### Key Features

- **Y-axis:** Potential energy
- **X-axis:** Reaction progress (or reaction coordinate)
- **Reactants:** The starting point on the left of the diagram.
- **Products:** The ending point on the right of the diagram.
- **Transition State:** The peak of the curve, representing the highest energy point in the reaction.
- **[[Activation Energy (Ea)]]**: The difference in energy between the reactants and the transition state.
- **Enthalpy Change (ΔH):** The difference in energy between the products and the reactants.

### Exothermic vs. Endothermic Reactions

- **Exothermic Reaction:** The products are at a lower energy level than the reactants (ΔH is negative). The reaction releases energy.
- **Endothermic Reaction:** The products are at a higher energy level than the reactants (ΔH is positive). The reaction absorbs energy.

### Effect of a Catalyst

A [[Catalysts|catalyst]] lowers the activation energy of a reaction, which is represented by a lower peak on the energy profile diagram. The catalyst does not affect the energy of the reactants or products, so the enthalpy change (ΔH) remains the same.
