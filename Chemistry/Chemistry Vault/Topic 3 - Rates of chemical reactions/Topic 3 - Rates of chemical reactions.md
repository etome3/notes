## Core Concepts

### [[Rates of Reactions]]
- **[[Factors Affecting Reaction Rate]]**: Investigating how temperature, concentration, surface area, pressure, and catalysts affect the rate of a reaction.
- **[[Collision Theory]]**: A model that explains how these factors influence the rate of reaction by considering the collisions between reactant particles.
- **[[Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution]]**: Understanding the distribution of kinetic energies in a sample of particles and how it is affected by temperature and catalysts.

### [[Activation Energy]]
- **[[Energy Profile Diagrams]]**: Sketching and interpreting energy profile diagrams to visualize the activation energy and enthalpy change of a reaction.
- **[[Role of Catalysts]]**: Explaining how catalysts increase the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy.

### [[Measuring Reaction Rates]]
- **[[Calculating Reaction Rate]]**: Determining the rate of a reaction by measuring the change in concentration of reactants or products over time.
- **[[Graphical Analysis]]**: Analyzing graphs of concentration, volume, or mass versus time to determine the rate of a reaction.
