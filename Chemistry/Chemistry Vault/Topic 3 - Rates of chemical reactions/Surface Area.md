# Surface Area and Reaction Rate

When reactants are in different phases (e.g., a solid and a liquid), the reaction rate is affected by the surface area of the interface between the phases.

Increasing the surface area of a solid reactant (for example, by grinding it into a powder) exposes more of its particles to the other reactant. This leads to more frequent collisions and a faster reaction rate.
