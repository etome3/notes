# Role of Catalysts in Chemical Reactions

A **catalyst** is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. Catalysts work by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower [[Activation Energy]].

### How Catalysts Work

By lowering the activation energy, catalysts allow a larger proportion of reactant molecules to have sufficient energy to be converted into products. This results in a significant increase in the reaction rate.

Catalysts interact with reactants to form intermediate compounds that require less energy to form than the intermediates in the uncatalyzed reaction. After the final product is formed, the catalyst is regenerated and can participate in further reactions.

It's important to note that catalysts do not change the overall thermodynamics or equilibrium of a reaction; they only affect the kinetics, or the speed at which the reaction reaches equilibrium.

### Types of Catalysts

Catalysts can be broadly classified into three main types:

*   **Homogeneous Catalysts:** These catalysts exist in the same phase (solid, liquid, or gas) as the reactants.
*   **Heterogeneous Catalysts:** These catalysts are in a different phase from the reactants. Typically, they are solids that catalyze reactions of gaseous or liquid reactants. A common example is the catalytic converter in automobiles.
*   **Biocatalysts (Enzymes):** These are proteins that act as catalysts in biological systems. Enzymes are highly specific and are essential for processes like digestion and metabolism.

### Examples of Catalysts

**Industrial Processes:**
*   **Haber-Bosch Process:** Uses an iron catalyst to produce ammonia.
*   **Contact Process:** Vanadium(V) oxide is used as a catalyst in the production of sulfuric acid.
*   **Petroleum Refining:** Zeolites are used in catalytic cracking.

**Biological Systems:**
*   **Amylase** in saliva breaks down starch.
*   **Enzymes** in metabolism.
