## The Speed of Chemical Change

The rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how fast the reactants are converted into products. It is typically expressed as the change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit of time.

### Formula

$$ \text{Rate of reaction} = \frac{\text{change in concentration}}{\text{time taken}} $$

- For reactants, the change in concentration is negative (since they are being consumed), so we often use the negative of the change in reactant concentration to get a positive rate.

$$ \text{Rate} = -\frac{\Delta[\text{Reactant}]}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta[\text{Product}]}{\Delta t} $$

### [[Factors Affecting Reaction Rate]]

Several factors can influence the rate of a chemical reaction:

1.  **[[Temperature]]**: Higher temperature leads to a faster reaction rate.
2.  **[[Concentration]]**: Higher concentration of reactants leads to a faster reaction rate.
3.  **[[Surface Area]]**: Increasing the surface area of a solid reactant increases the reaction rate.
4.  **[[Pressure]]** (for gaseous reactants): Higher pressure leads to a faster reaction rate.
5.  **[[Catalysts]]**: A catalyst increases the reaction rate without being consumed in the reaction.

### [[Collision Theory]]

Collision theory explains how these factors affect the reaction rate at the molecular level. It states that for a reaction to occur, reactant particles must collide with sufficient energy and in the correct orientation.
