# Temperature and Reaction Rate

Increasing the temperature increases the rate of a chemical reaction. This is because:

1.  **Increased Kinetic Energy:** At higher temperatures, particles have more kinetic energy and move faster. This leads to more frequent collisions between reactant particles.
2.  **Activation Energy:** More importantly, a higher temperature means that a larger fraction of the reactant molecules will have the minimum amount of energy required for a reaction to occur, known as the activation energy. This results in a higher proportion of effective collisions.
