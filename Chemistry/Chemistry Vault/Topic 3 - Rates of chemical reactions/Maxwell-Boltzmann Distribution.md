## The Distribution of Kinetic Energies

A Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve is a graph that shows the distribution of kinetic energies among the particles in a sample of gas at a given temperature.

### Key Features of the Curve

- **Area under the curve:** Represents the total number of particles in the sample.
- **Peak of the curve:** Represents the most probable kinetic energy.
- **No particles with zero energy:** The curve starts at the origin.
- **No maximum energy:** The curve is asymptotic to the x-axis.

### Effect of Temperature

- As the temperature increases, the curve flattens and shifts to the right.
- The average kinetic energy of the particles increases.
- The number of particles with energy greater than the [[Activation Energy (Ea)]] increases significantly, leading to a faster reaction rate.

### Effect of a Catalyst

- A [[Catalysts|catalyst]] provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea,cat).
- This means that a greater proportion of the particles will have sufficient energy to react, leading to a faster reaction rate.
- The catalyst does not change the shape of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution curve.
