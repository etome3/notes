### Key Points

- **Catalysis and Enzymes:** The study of [[Catalysts|catalysts]] is a major field of chemistry, with applications ranging from industrial manufacturing to environmental remediation. The understanding of enzyme structure and function is particularly important in biochemistry and medicine.

- **Isotopic Tracers:** The work of scientists like Mildred Cohn, who used isotopic tracers and NMR spectroscopy to study enzymatic catalysis, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of reaction mechanisms.

- **Corrosion:** The prevention of corrosion is a major economic and engineering challenge. Our understanding of [[Rates of Reactions|reaction rates]] and electrochemical processes is essential for developing effective methods of corrosion control.

- **Collision Theory:** The development of [[Collision Theory]] has been a key step in our ability to explain and predict the rates of a wide variety of chemical reactions.
