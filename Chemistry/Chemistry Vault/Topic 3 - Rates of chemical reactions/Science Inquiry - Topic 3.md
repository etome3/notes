### Investigations

- **Factors Affecting Reaction Rate:**
    - Design and conduct experiments to investigate how factors such as [[Temperature]], [[Concentration]], and [[Surface Area]] affect the rate of a chemical reaction.
    - Collect and analyze data to draw conclusions about the relationships between these factors and the reaction rate.

- **Measuring Reaction Rates:**
    - Use various techniques to measure the rate of a reaction, such as:
        - Collecting a gas and measuring the change in volume over time.
        - Monitoring the change in color of a solution.
        - Measuring the change in mass of a reactant.

- **Catalysis:**
    - Investigate the effect of a [[Catalysts|catalyst]] on the rate of a reaction.
    - Compare the rates of a reaction with and without a catalyst.
