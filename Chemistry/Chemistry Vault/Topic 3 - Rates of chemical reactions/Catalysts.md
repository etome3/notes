## Speeding Up Chemical Reactions

A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. Catalysts work by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower [[Activation Energy (Ea)]].

### How Catalysts Work

- **Lowering Activation Energy:** By providing a different mechanism for the reaction, a catalyst reduces the energy barrier that needs to be overcome for the reaction to occur.
- **No Change in Enthalpy:** A catalyst does not affect the overall enthalpy change (Î”H) of the reaction. It only changes the rate at which the reaction reaches equilibrium.

### [[Energy Profile Diagrams]]

On an energy profile diagram, the effect of a catalyst is shown as a lower activation energy peak.

### Types of Catalysts

- **Homogeneous Catalysts:** In the same phase as the reactants (e.g., a liquid catalyst in a liquid reaction).
- **Heterogeneous Catalysts:** In a different phase from the reactants (e.g., a solid catalyst in a gas-phase reaction).
- **Enzymes:** Biological catalysts that are highly specific and efficient.

### Importance of Catalysts

Catalysts are extremely important in many industrial processes, as they can:

- Increase the rate of production.
- Reduce the energy costs of a process by allowing it to be run at a lower temperature.
- Improve the selectivity of a reaction, leading to a higher yield of the desired product.
