# Graphical Analysis of Reaction Rates

Graphical analysis is a powerful method for determining the order of a reaction and its rate constant. This is done by manipulating the integrated rate laws into the form of a straight-line equation (`y = mx + c`). By plotting concentration data in different ways, we can identify the reaction order by observing which plot results in a straight line.

### Zero-Order Reactions

For a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant.

-   A plot of **concentration `[A]` versus time `t`** will be a straight line.
-   **Equation:** `[A] = -kt + [A]₀`
-   **Slope (m):** `-k` (where `k` is the rate constant)
-   **Y-intercept (c):** `[A]₀` (the initial concentration)

### First-Order Reactions

For a first-order reaction, the rate is directly proportional to the concentration of one reactant.

-   A plot of the **natural logarithm of concentration `ln[A]` versus time `t`** will be a straight line.
-   **Equation:** `ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]₀`
-   **Slope (m):** `-k`
-   **Y-intercept (c):** `ln[A]₀`

### Second-Order Reactions

For a second-order reaction, the rate is proportional to the square of the concentration of a reactant.

-   A plot of the **reciprocal of concentration `1/[A]` versus time `t`** will be a straight line.
-   **Equation:** `1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]₀`
-   **Slope (m):** `k`
-   **Y-intercept (c):** `1/[A]₀`

### Summary Table

| Reaction Order | Plot for Linear Fit | Slope of Line | Rate Constant (k) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Zero-Order | `[A]` vs. `t` | `-k` | `k = -slope` |
| First-Order | `ln[A]` vs. `t` | `-k` | `k = -slope` |
| Second-Order | `1/[A]` vs. `t`| `k` | `k = slope` |
