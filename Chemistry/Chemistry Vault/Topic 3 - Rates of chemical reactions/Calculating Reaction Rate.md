# Calculating Reaction Rate

The rate of a chemical reaction is the measure of how quickly reactants are converted into products. It can be calculated in a few ways, depending on the available data.

### Average Reaction Rate

The average rate of reaction is calculated over a specific time interval. For a general reaction, `A → B`:

-   **Rate based on reactant A (disappearance):**
    `Rate = -Δ[A] / Δt`
    The square brackets `[A]` denote the concentration of A, `Δ` signifies a change, and `t` is time. The negative sign is used because the concentration of a reactant decreases over time, and reaction rates are always expressed as positive values.

-   **Rate based on product B (appearance):**
    `Rate = Δ[B] / Δt`

### Instantaneous Reaction Rate

The instantaneous rate is the rate of reaction at a single moment in time. It is determined by finding the slope of a line tangent to a point on a concentration-versus-time graph. In calculus terms, this is the derivative of concentration with respect to time (`-d[A]/dt` or `d[B]/dt`).

### Rate Law

The rate law is an equation that relates the reaction rate to the concentrations of the reactants. For a reaction `aA + bB → products`, the rate law is typically written as:

`Rate = k[A]^m[B]^n`

Where:
-   `k` is the **rate constant**, a value specific to the reaction at a given temperature.
-   `[A]` and `[B]` are the molar concentrations of the reactants.
-   `m` and `n` are the **reaction orders**, which must be determined experimentally. They are not necessarily the same as the stoichiometric coefficients `a` and `b`.
