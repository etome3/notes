## The Basis of Chemical Reactions

Collision theory is a model that explains how chemical reactions occur and why reaction rates differ for different reactions. It is based on the idea that for a reaction to proceed, reactant particles must collide with each other.

### Key Principles

For a collision to be effective and lead to the formation of products, two conditions must be met:

1.  **Sufficient Energy:** The colliding particles must have a total kinetic energy equal to or greater than the [[Activation Energy (Ea)]] of the reaction.
2.  **Correct Orientation:** The particles must collide in the correct spatial orientation to allow the necessary bonds to be broken and new bonds to be formed.

### Explaining the Factors Affecting Reaction Rate

Collision theory can be used to explain how various factors influence the rate of a reaction:

- **[[Temperature]]**: Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of the particles, leading to more frequent and more energetic collisions. This increases the proportion of collisions that have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy.
- **[[Concentration]]**: Increasing the concentration of reactants increases the number of particles in a given volume, which leads to more frequent collisions.
- **[[Surface Area]]**: Increasing the surface area of a solid reactant exposes more particles to the other reactants, leading to more frequent collisions.
- **[[Pressure]]** (for gases): Increasing the pressure of a gaseous system forces the particles closer together, leading to more frequent collisions.
