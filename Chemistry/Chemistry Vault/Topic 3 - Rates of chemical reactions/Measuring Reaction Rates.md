# Measuring Reaction Rates

The rate of a chemical reaction is the speed at which reactants are converted into products. To measure a reaction rate, we must track the change in concentration of a reactant or product over time. The choice of method depends on the specific reaction and the properties of the substances involved.

### Methods for Measuring Reaction Rates

Common methods for measuring reaction rates include:

*   **Spectroscopy:** This technique monitors changes in light absorption or emission that are related to the concentration of reactants or products. For example, a colorimeter or spectrophotometer can be used to measure the change in color of a solution as a reaction progresses.
*   **Gas Volume Measurement:** If a reaction produces a gas, the rate can be determined by measuring the volume of gas evolved over time. This can be done using a gas syringe or by displacing water in an inverted container.
*   **Mass Loss:** If a reaction produces a gas that is allowed to escape, the rate can be determined by measuring the decrease in mass of the reaction mixture over time.
*   **Titration:** This method involves taking samples from the reaction mixture at specific time intervals and analyzing the concentration of a reactant or product by titrating it with a suitable reagent.
*   **Conductometry:** For reactions involving ions, the rate can be measured by monitoring the change in electrical conductivity of the solution.
*   **Calorimetry:** This method measures the heat released or absorbed during a reaction, which can be related to the reaction rate.
