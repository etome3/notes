# Pressure and Reaction Rate

For reactions involving gases, increasing the pressure increases the reaction rate.

This is because increasing the pressure of a gas is equivalent to increasing its concentration. The gas molecules are forced closer together, leading to more frequent collisions and thus a faster reaction rate.
