## The Energy Barrier for Reactions

Activation energy (Ea) is the minimum amount of energy that must be supplied to the reactants to initiate a chemical reaction.

### Analogy: Pushing a Ball Up a Hill

Think of activation energy as the energy required to push a ball up a hill before it can roll down the other side. The reaction can only proceed if the reactants have enough energy to overcome this energy barrier.

### [[Energy Profile Diagrams]]

Activation energy is represented on an energy profile diagram as the difference in energy between the reactants and the transition state (the peak of the curve).

### Factors Affecting Activation Energy

- **Nature of the reaction:** Different reactions have different activation energies.
- **[[Catalysts]]**: A catalyst increases the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. It does not affect the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction.

### Relationship with Reaction Rate

- A higher activation energy corresponds to a slower reaction rate, as fewer particles will have sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier.
- A lower activation energy corresponds to a faster reaction rate.
