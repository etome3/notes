### Understanding: 
•  An action potential consists of depolarization and repolarization of the neuron 

Action potentials are the rapid changes in charge across the membrane that occur when a neuron is firing 
- Action potentials occur in three main stages: depolarization, repolarization and a refractory period 
## Depolarisation 
Depolarisation refers to a sudden change in membrane potential – usually from a (relatively) negative to positive internal charge 
- In response to a signal initiated at a dendrite, *sodium channels* open within the membrane of the axon
- As Na+ ions are more concentrated outside of the neuron, the opening of sodium channels causes a passive influx of sodium  
- The influx of sodium causes the membrane potential to become more positive (depolarisation)

## Repolarisation 
Repolarisation refers to the restoration of a membrane potential following depolarisation (i.e. restoring a negative internal charge) 
- Following an influx of sodium, *potassium channels* open within the membrane of the axon 
- As K+ ions are more concentrated inside the neuron, opening potassium channels causes a <u>passive efflux of potassium</u>
- The efflux of potassium causes the membrane potential to return to a more negative internal differential (repolarisation)
