**Use the Enzymes PowerPoint to answer Q 1-5.**

1. Describe the role of an enzymes active site.

The active site is an enzyme’s specific region where the substrate binds, and catalysis occurs. The active site is usually a cleft or pocket at the surface of the enzyme. Substrate modification occurs at the active site. This specificity ensures that enzymes catalyse only their intended reactions.

1. Use the induced fit model to outline how an active site works.

According to the induced fit model, the enzyme action process begins with two substrate molecules being drawn into the cleft of the enzyme. Following this, the enzyme changes shape, forcing the substrate molecules to combine. The resulting end product is released by the enzyme which returns to its normal shape, ready to undergo more reactions. 

1. Contrast anabolic and catabolic reactions.

Anabolic reactions involve the joining of smaller molecules to form larger ones, while catabolic reactions involve the breakdown of larger molecules into smaller ones. Anabolic reactions typically require energy input, while catabolic reactions release energy.

1. List factors that affect enzyme activity.

Factors that affect enzyme activity include temperature and pH, as most enzymes have an optimal range where they can operate properly. Other factors are enzyme concentration, which linearly increases the rate of reaction, and substrate concentration, which increases the reaction rate and plateaus (assuming a fixed enzyme concentration).

1. Explain how protein denaturation effects enzyme function. Include a diagram in your response.

Denaturation of an enzyme involves the alteration of its structural bonds as a result of unfavourable conditions, which can lead to the changing of the enzyme’s shape active site. This renders the enzyme useless until it returns to favourable conditions.

1. Explain why the arrangement of internal membranes in organelles such as mitochondria assist with cell function.

The arrangement of the mitochondria’s internal membranes is crucial, as the outer membrane controls the passage of materials involved in aerobic respiration, and the inner membranes (cristae) provide the attachment sites for the enzymes involved in cellular respiration. Together, these membranes contribute to cell function by facilitating the process of ATP synthesis.

1. Describe the change in the rate of reaction when enzyme concentration is increased assuming there is plenty of substrate present.

The rate of reaction increases linearly as the enzyme concentration is increased.

1. Describe the change in reaction rate when substrate concentration is increased assuming there is a fixed amount of enzyme present.

The increase of substrate concentration with a fixed amount of enzyme leads to a logarithmic increase in the rate of reaction, diminishing and reaching a plateau.

1. Describe what is meant by an optimum temperature for enzyme activity.

The optimum temperature for enzyme activity is a temperature that is neither too low for efficient enzyme operation nor too high to cause rapid denaturation.

1. State the optimum pH ranges for pepsin, trypsin and urease.

The optimum pH range for pepsin is from about 1 to 3, for trypsin it is from about 6 to 10, and for urease it is from about 5 to 9.

1. Pepsin acts on proteins in the stomach. Explain how its optimum pH is suited to its working environment.

Pepsin’s lower optimum pH (pH 1-3) allows the enzyme to function efficiently within the extremely acidic environment of the stomach (pH 1.5-3.5). This prevents the enzyme’s denaturation and ensures its optimal performance in the breaking down of proteins.

1. Explain what might happen to an enzymes activity if a mutation caused a change to the shape of an active site.

A mutation that causes a change to the shape of an enzyme’s active site would likely reduce or eliminate the enzyme’s function, as its capability to bind with substrate molecules would suffer greatly.
