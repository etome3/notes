# <u>The Nervous System</u>
The nervous system is a complex collection of nerves and specialized cells known as neurons that transmit signals between different parts of the body.​
The nervous system comprises the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).​
 
## **The Central Nervous System and the Peripheral Nervous System**
### Central Nervous System:
Integrates information it receives from nerves all over the body then coordinates and influences the activity of all parts of the body.​
Components:​
- Brain​
- Spinal Cord
<u>Automatic</u> influences involuntary functions including heart rate, breathing and digestion.​
<u>Somatic</u> influences voluntary muscle movements.​
### Peripheral Nervous System:
Consists of nerves outside the central nervous system​
Connects to the limbs and organs, serving as a communication relay between the brain and spinal cord with the rest of the body​.
 
## **Neurons**
Neurons are the basic cellular unit of the nervous system. ​
Many neurons together make a nerve fibre. ​
Bundles of nerve fibres make a nerve.​
Each nerve is wrapped in a tube of connective tissue. ​
### Neuron Structure:
Dendrites receive messages from other neurons and send them to the cell body ​
Cell body is the ‘factory’ of the neuron (contains organelles)​
Axons carry messages away from the cell body ​
Synaptic terminals are the contact point with next neuron​
### The Synapse:
Small space across which an impulse moves from an axon to the dendrites or cell body of another neuron.​
Impulse reaches end of axon.​ → Axon releases chemical. (neurotransmitter)​ → Chemical stimulates the impulse in next dendrite.​
### Myelination:
Myelin is a layer of fatty cells called Schwann cells segmentally encasing the fibres of many neurons.​
Enables vastly greater transmission speed of neutral impulses and stops the message from accidently crossing over to a neighbouring neuron.

## **Types of Neurons**
### Sensory Neurons:
Receive information from receptors and send information to the brain.
Axons can be as long as 1.5m in adults.
### Motor Neurons:
Conduct impulses away from the brain or spinal cord to muscles or glands throughout your body.
### Interneurons:
Send impulses from sensory neurons to motor neurons.​
Primarily located within the brain and spinal cord.
