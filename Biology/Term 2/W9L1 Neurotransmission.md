### Role of interneurons in neural pathways
Interneurons are crucial for processing and integrating information within the central nervous system (CNS). They act as intermediaries between sensory neurons, which bring information from sensory receptors, and motor neurons, which carry commands to muscles and glands. Interneurons facilitate complex reflexes and higher-order functions by relaying signals between different brain regions or spinal cord segments, enabling coordinated responses and decision-making.

### Sensory neurons and motor neurons
Sensory neurons and motor neurons have distinct functions within neural pathways. Sensory neurons carry information from sensory receptors to the central nervous system, allowing the body to perceive stimuli such as touch, temperature, and pain. In contrast, motor neurons transmit signals from the CNS to effectors, such as muscles and glands, resulting in actions like muscle contraction or gland secretion. Sensory neurons relay input to the CNS, while motor neurons carry output from the CNS.

## Resting membrane potential
When a neuron is not sending a signal, it is â€œat rest". When a neuron is at rest, the inside of the neuron is **negative relative to the outside**. Although the concentrations of the different ions attempt to balance out on both sides of the membrane, they cannot because the cell membrane allows only some ions to pass through channels (ion channels). At rest, **potassium ions** (K+) can cross through the membrane **easily** whereas **sodium ions** (Na+) have a more **difficult** time crossing.

In addition to these selective ion channels, there is a **pump** that uses energy to **move three sodium ions out** of the neuron for **every two potassium ions it puts in**. The resting membrane potential of a neuron is about **-70 mV** (mV=millivolt) - this means that the inside of the neuron is 70 mV less than the outside. At rest, there are relatively **more sodium ions outside the neuron** and **more potassium ions inside that neuron.**
## Action potential
An **action potential** occurs when a neuron sends information down an **axon**, away from the cell body. The action potential is an explosion of electrical activity that is created by a **depolarising** current. This means that some event (a stimulus) causes the resting potential to move toward 0 mV. When the depolarisation reaches about **-55 mV** a neuron will fire an action potential. This is the **threshold**. If the neuron does not reach this critical threshold level, then no action potential will fire.

Action potentials are caused when different ions cross the neuron membrane. A stimulus first causes **sodium channels** to open. Because there are many more sodium ions on the outside, and the inside of the neuron is negative relative to the outside, **sodium ions rush into the neuron**. Remember, sodium has a positive charge, so the neuron becomes more positive and becomes depolarised.

It takes longer for **potassium channels** to open. When they do open, potassium rushes out of the cell, reversing the depolarisation. Also at about this time, **sodium channels start to close**. This causes the action potential to go back toward **-70 mV (a repolarisation)**. The action potential actually goes **past -70 mV (a hyperpolarisation)** because the potassium channels stay open a bit too long. Gradually, the ion concentrations go back to resting levels and the cell returns to -70 mV.

## Neurotransmission and role of neurotransmitters
**Neurotransmission**, also called synaptic transmission, is the process by which **signalling molecules** called **neurotransmitters** are released by a neuron (the presynaptic neuron), and bind to and activate the **receptors** of another neuron (the postsynaptic neuron). Neurotransmission is essential for the process of **communication** between two neurons.

A neurotransmitter is a **chemical messenger** that carries, boosts and modulates signals between neurons and other cells in the body. Neurotransmitters are stored in **synaptic vesicles** clustered beneath the membrane in the **axon terminal** located at the presynaptic side of the **synapse** (small gap separating neurons).

In response to an **action potentia**l reaching the synapse, neurotransmitters are released into and diffused across the synaptic cleft, where they bind to **specific receptors in the membrane** on the postsynaptic side of the synapse. This binding of receptors triggers a process called **signal transduction**.

## Transmission within the neuron vs between different neurons
Within the neuron the message is transmitted as a wave of action potentials, with movement of sodium and potassium ions causing rapid depolariation then repolarisation. Transmission may be increased in speed with the presence of a myelin sheath.

To pass the message from one neuron to the next, the action potential triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic membrane across the synaptic cleft to trigger receptors on the postsynaptic membrane of the next neuron.

Both involve transmission of the impulses. Transmission within the neuron is much faster than synaptic transmission.

The synaptic transmission can only occur in one direction, so helps control the direction of the impulse.

## Myelin
Myelin is formed by cells called Schwann cells that wrap themselves around the axon of some neurons. It insulates the axon. Between the myelin sheaths are gaps known as the nodes of Ranvier, where sodium channels can access the extracellular fluid. Here there is depolarisation, then the impulse jumps to the next node, speeding up transmission. This is known as saltatory conduction. It helps conserve both space and energy. Evidence comes from comparing rates of transmission in myelinated and non-myelinated neurons.
