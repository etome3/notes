Enzyme activity

### Temperature's Effect on Enzyme Activity

As temperature increases from 0°C to an optimum temperature around 32°C, enzyme activity rises steadily. This reflects that there is not enough energy for the enzyme to operate when it is too cold. Beyond the optimum temperature, enzyme activity rapidly declines to zero at around 45°C. This reflects that the enzyme denatures at high temperatures.
