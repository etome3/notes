Enzyme activity: pH levels

The optimal function of enzymes occurs within a specific pH range. Pepsin exhibits its highest activity in acidic environments, with its peak effectiveness around pH 2. As the pH increases towards neutral and alkaline levels, the activity of Pepsin decreases significantly. Urease functions optimally at a near-neutral pH of approximately 6, while Trypsin operates most effectively in a more alkaline environment, around pH 8. As the pH shifts away from the optimal range for each enzyme, its activity declines.
