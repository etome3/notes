## Limitations of the evidence, Bolded: Analysis of Evidence​ - Thorough and appropriate identification of the uncertainty and limitations of evidence.

Standard error, overlapping error bars and confidence intervals are all examples of the uncertainty and limitations observed from an analysis of the evidence. This can be explained by a lack of reliability and validity in the experimental process. ​

The masses recorded for the algal biomasses were inconsistent (refer to Table 1, see standard deviation) hence the average percentage change is calculated from data that lacks some reliability, as indicated by the standard error. This suggests that not all variables were fully controlled. **Also, the standard error of the greywater treatment data was higher than the control treatment (refer to Figure 2) which may suggest low precision in the measuring instrument or high random biological variation in the samples.**

The **low sample size** of this experiment is a major factor in **determining the length of the confidence intervals** (refer to Figure 2). Consequently, **the evidence is limited in its ability to be used to extrapolate the findings** of the experiment to the population of Chlorella spp. ​

**An outlier (for the greywater treatment) was identified.** However, this **was not confirmed as a valid extreme value** through experimentation; consequently, the **mean reported may have altered the results of the data analysis.**

## Interpretation and Evaluation, Bolded: Justified discussion of the reliability and validity of the results.

Sources of error effecting reliability ​

• The electronic balance used to measure the mass of Chlorella spp. is **imprecise (±0.01g). Therefore, the electronic balance contributes to the imprecision of the data. However, the variation in the data is greater than ±0.01g; therefore, there must be other sources of imprecision.**

• The samples were not randomly selected and the strain of Chlorella spp. was not genetically screened. Random biological variation exists within the sample. **This could explain some of the remaining imprecision in the data.**

• The composition of the greywater was not determined prior to conducting the experiment. **Therefore, it is not known which abiotic and biotic factors are affecting the growth of the Chlorella spp.**

Sources of error effecting validity ​

• The sodium alginate leads to a wet rather than dry biomass reading. **Therefore, the mass of the data is overestimated.** In addition, the algal biomass is determined indirectly which could lead to greater variability in the data. ​

• The electronic balance does not count algae cells directly. **The equipment used is not the most appropriate to collect data.** Therefore, this could contribute to the data being inaccurate. ​
