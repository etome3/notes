## Overall:
- No statistical analyses (ANOVA or T-test), need these to make a conclusion. Trend in increase exists, however your P-values will most likely show that, due to the std dev and small sample size, that the differences between the averages from 1->2->4mL are not statistically significant differences. Trends and relationships must be confirmed by statistics!

## Analysis of graphs/tables:
- Condense individual interpretations and analyses into a collective interpretation and analysis of all data representations to avoid redundancy, while still expressing a clear analysis of each distinct statistic/value
