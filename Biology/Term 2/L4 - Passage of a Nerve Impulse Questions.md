- Is the membrane protein assisting with active or passive transport? Explain why.
- Identify the number of Na+ ions that are pumped in to the extracellular environment by a sodium potassium pump.
- Identify the number of K+ ions that are pumped in to the intracellular environment by a sodium potassium pump.
- Use the diagram to draw a conclusion about the charge of the intracellular environment compared to the charge of the extracellular environment.

### **Passage of a Nerve Impulse**
When an axon is not transmitting an impulse it is slightly positive on the inside and very positive on the outside.  
External or internal stimuli can initiate a nerve impulse. 
Stimulus detection by a receptor initiates a message by opening up ion channels in the cell membrane of the dendrites.
Open ion channels allowing ions to move across the cell membrane. 
The influx of positive ions changes the net charge inside a neuron and starts a cascade of electrical activity down the axon.
- Identify the cause of nerve impulse initiation.

### **Resting Potential**
When the outside of a neuron is more positive than the inside, this is known as resting potential.
- Define the term resting potential.
- Explain how a neuron achieves resting potential.

### **Action Potential**
When an impulse is triggered, the membrane become more permeable to sodium ions.
The sodium ions that have been actively pumped outside of the cell are about 10 times more concentrated than they are on the inside of the cell, so they diffuse rapidly.
This leads to a large positive charge on the inside of the cell and a small charge on the outside.
The sudden change in membrane potential is called depolarisation and results in action potential.
The small action potential travels like a ripple along an axon.
- Define the term depolarisation.
- Explain why sodium ions diffuse rapidly when sodium channels open.
- Describe the movement of an action potential.
- Explain how resting potential would be restored (repolarisation) after depolarisation.

### **Transmission between Neurons**
A signal is passed from one neuron to another by converting it from an electrical signal to a chemical signal called neurotransmitters.
Neurotransmitters are stored in vesicles in the presynaptic neuron.
When an impulse arrives at the synapse, it causes calcium ions channel to open causing an influx of calcium ions which stimulates exocytosis of neurotransmitters.
The neurotransmitters bind with receptors of the postsynaptic cell, causing ion channels to open there and trigger an action potential in the target neuron.
Excess neurotransmitters are deactivated by enzymes and recycled back in to the presynaptic cleft in a process called reuptake.
- Define the term neurotransmitter.
- Explain how a message is passed from one neuron to another.
- Define the term reuptake.
### **Repolarisation**
Repolarization typically results from the movement of positively charged K+ ions out of the cell.
Repolarization is vital because it restores the K+ ion concentration in the extracellular space, allowing the sodium potassium pumps to restore resting potential.â€‹
