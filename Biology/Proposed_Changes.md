# Proposed Changes for Biology

The current structure of the Biology folder is organized by term. To unify the structure with the `Ancient History/Holiday Notes` folder, the following changes are proposed:

*   **Create a main "Map of Content" (MOC) file:** This file, named `MOC - Biology.md`, will serve as a central hub for all topics related to Biology.
*   **Create new folders for note categories:**
    *   `00 - MOCs`
    *   `01 - Topics`
    *   `02 - Experiments`
    *   `03 - Concepts`
    *   `04 - Theories`
    *   `05 - Scientists`
*   **Move existing notes:** The notes currently in `Term 1`, `Term 2`, and `Term 3` should be moved to the appropriate new folders.
*   **Create an `Attachments` folder:** This folder will store any images or other files related to the notes.
*   **Rename `Biology.md` to `00 - Biology MOC.md` and move it to `00 - MOCs`**
*   **The `space` folder can remain as is.**
