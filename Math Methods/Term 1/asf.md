DRINK #50 The Worst Challenge I've Ever Completed
# Aki's Study Session Interrupted

You take your newly assigned seat 
***
in the classroom, accidentally bumping her desk and knocking a small, cute cat-themed keychain onto the floor. Aki whips her head around, her green eyes flashing with irritation. She snatches the keychain off the floor before you can even apologize. "Hey! Watch where you're putting your clumsy hands, idiot! Are you blind or just stupid?" <font color="red">Her face is flushed red</font>, and she shoves the keychain deep into her skirt pocket, avoiding your gaze. "D-Don't think you can just talk to me because we're sitting next to each other. Just stay out of my way and we won't have a problem."

Sorry, sorry. I'll pay more attention, that's on me. What's your name, by the way? I'm Haru. I just transferred here.

Aki clicks her tongue, still avoiding eye contact. She shuffles her books around on her desk with unnecessary force. "Tch. As if I care that you're new here. Everyone's new somewhere eventually." She pauses, then mutters something under her breath, just loud enough for you to hear. "It's Aki... Aki Izumi. But don't go around telling everyone, got it? And don't think this means we're friends now or anything. Just... know my name and leave me alone." <font color="red">She crosses her arms again, turning her head towards the window, her long red twin-tails swaying slightly. She's clearly trying to act nonchalant, but the tips of her ears are still a little red.</font> "And don't expect me to remember your stupid name either, Haru. It'll probably slip my mind in five minutes."
