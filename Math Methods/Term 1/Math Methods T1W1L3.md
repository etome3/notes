LG: I can understand the concept of a surd as an irrational number represented using a square root or a radical sign.

1. X = 2
2. X = -2
3. X = 3/5
4. Sqrt 7

|N = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}|The set of natural numbers, that is the positive whole numbers or counting numbers.|
|Z = {... -2, -1, 0,1, 2...}|The set of integers, that is all positive and negative whole numbers and the number zero.|
|Q =|The set of rational numbers: all numbers that can be expressed in the form a/b, b ≠ 0 and a, b € Z, that is all fractions, integers and finite and recurring decimals.|
|I =|The set of irrational numbers: all real numbers that are not rational. Some irrational numbers, such as π and _e,_ are called transcendental numbers.|
|R =|The set of real numbers, that is the union of the set of rational numbers and the set of irrational numbers.|

_Irrational Numbers:_ An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.

_Surds numbers:_ Surds are the values in square root that cannot be further simplified into whole numbers or integers. Surds are irrational numbers.
