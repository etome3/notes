# Logarithms

## Introduction
Logarithms are the inverse operation to exponentiation. A logarithm answers the question: "To what power must a given base be raised to produce a certain number?"

If $b^y = x$, then $\log_b(x) = y$.

## Key Properties
- **Product Rule:** $\log_b(xy) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)$
- **Quotient Rule:** $\log_b(\frac{x}{y}) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)$
- **Power Rule:** $\log_b(x^p) = p \cdot \log_b(x)$
- **Change of Base Formula:** $\log_b(x) = \frac{\log_c(x)}{\log_c(b)}$

## Common Logarithms
- **Common Logarithm:** Base 10, denoted as $\log(x)$ or $\log_{10}(x)$.
- **Natural Logarithm:** Base $e$ (Euler's number), denoted as $\ln(x)$.

## Relationship with Exponential Functions
Logarithms are the inverse of [[Exponential Functions/Exponential Functions|exponential functions]]. This means:
- $b^{\log_b(x)} = x$
- $\log_b(b^x) = x$

## Applications
Logarithms are used in various fields, including:
- Measuring sound intensity (decibels)
- Measuring earthquake intensity (Richter scale)
- pH scale in chemistry
