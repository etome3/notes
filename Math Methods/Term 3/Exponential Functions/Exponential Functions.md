# Exponential Functions

## Introduction
Exponential functions are functions of the form $f(x) = a^x$, where $a$ is a positive constant (the base) and $x$ is the exponent.

## Key Properties
- **Domain:** All real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)
- **Range:** All positive real numbers ($y > 0$)
- **Y-intercept:** Always (0, 1) since $a^0 = 1$
- **Asymptote:** The x-axis ($y=0$) is a horizontal asymptote.

## Graphs
- If $a > 1$, the function is increasing.
- If $0 < a < 1$, the function is decreasing.

## Applications
Exponential functions are used to model:
- Population growth
- Compound interest
- Radioactive decay

## Relationship with Logarithms
Exponential functions are closely related to [[Logarithms/Logarithms|logarithms]]. They are inverse functions of each other.
