# Introduction to Calculus

## What is Calculus?
Calculus is a branch of mathematics focused on limits, functions, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. It has two major branches:
- **Differential Calculus:** Deals with rates of change and slopes of curves.
- **Integral Calculus:** Deals with accumulation of quantities and areas under curves.

## Key Concepts
### Limits
- The concept of a limit is fundamental to calculus. It describes the behavior of a function as the input approaches a particular value.

### Derivatives
- The derivative of a function measures the sensitivity of change of the function's value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value).
- Geometrically, the derivative is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at a given point.

### Integrals
- The integral of a function can be thought of as the area under the curve of that function.
- It is the inverse operation of differentiation.

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- This theorem connects differential calculus and integral calculus. It states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations.

## Applications
Calculus is widely used in:
- Physics (motion, forces, energy)
- Engineering (design, optimization)
- Economics (marginal cost, revenue)
- Biology (population growth models)

## Prerequisites
- A strong understanding of [[Exponential Functions/Exponential Functions|exponential functions]] and [[Logarithms/Logarithms|logarithms]] is beneficial.
- Familiarity with algebra and trigonometry.
