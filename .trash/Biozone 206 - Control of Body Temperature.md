- Control of Body Temperature

# 273

**Key Idea:** Animals control body temperature by exchanging heat with their environment.

For a body to maintain a constant temperature heat losses must equal heat gains.Heat exchanges with the environment

occur via three mechanisms: **condu ction** (direct heat transfer), **radiation** (indirect heat transfer), and **evaporation.** The importance of each of these mechanismsdepends on environment, i.e. air or water.

Seals, whales and dolphins have heavily insulated surfaces of fat or blubber (up to 60%of body thickness). Blood is diverted to the outside of the blubber in warm

Large body size reduces heat loss by lowering the surface area to volume ratio.

Water has a great capacity to transfer heat away from organisms; its cooling power can be more than 50 times greater than that of air.For most aquatic animals (with the exception of aquatic birds and mammals and a few fish) heat retention is impossible.Instead, they carry out their metabolic activities at the ambient temperature. For most marine organisms this does not fluctuate much.

Heat loss from flippers and tail flukes is minimised by the use of count ercurren t heat exch angers in which heat is transferred between arterial

In all animals, metabolic activity generates heat.

In fasl swimming fish, such as Iuna, martin, and some sharks, heal exchangers are usedto mainlain lemperatures as high as 14"C above the water temperalure in lhe swimming muscles,

and venous blood flows.

In animals with gills, there is a high rate of heat loss across the thin gill surface.There is little point in surface insulation of the body, because all the arterial blood coming from the gills is already at water temperalure.

Fo r mos t mammals, the thickness of the fur or hair varies around the body (asindicateoabove).Thermoregulation is assisted by adopting body positions that expose or cover areas of thin fur (the figures above are for the llama-like guanaco).

Animals adapted to temperature extremes (hot or cold) can often tolerate large fluctuations in their body temperature before they become stressed. In camels, the body temperature may fluctuate up to 7°C (34"C to 41°C) over a 24 hour period.

Panting to lose accumulated heat is importantin dogs, which have sweat glands only on the pads of their feet.

**Countercurrent Heat Exchange Systems**

## Countercurrent heat exchange systems occur in both aquatic and terrestrial animals as an adaptation to maintaining a stable core temperature. The diagram illustrates the general principle ofcountercurrentheatexchangers: heat is exchanged between incoming and outgoing blood. In the flippers and fins of whales

![Biozone 206 - Control of Body Temperature](<Biology/Term 3/Attachments/Biozone 206 - Control of Body Temperature 13.jpeg>)

and dolphins, and the legs of aquatic birds, they minimise heat loss. In some terrestrial animals adapted to hot climates, the countercurrent exchange mechanism works in the opposite way to prevent the head from overheating: venous blood cools the arterial blood before it supplies the brain.

Bloodflow back to the body core

Bloodin the **vein** gains heat from the warmer artery as it flows back towards the body.
